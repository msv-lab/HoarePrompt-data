You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: *`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeroes; `s` is a string input; `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`; `five`, `two`, `seven` are the counts of '5', '2', '7' respectively in `s; `ans` is updated based on the calculations within the loop; `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions met within the loop; `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans` + 2. If there are at least one '2' and one '5' in the string `s`, the function enters the if block. Inside the if block, `t` is a list created from `s` where elements are shifted to the right, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2' in the reversed list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of the element at index `i + 1` in list `t`. The first element of list `t` is set to '0' if `n` is 3 or not '0' otherwise. The loop does not execute after the if block. If there is at least one '7' and one '5' in the string `s`, then `fin` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `ans`. If `zero >= 1 and five >= 1`, `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + (n - 2), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2` if `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at the last index of list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, if `t` contains '5' we break out of the loop, `t` is reversed in the end. Additionally, the first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is equal to 3, `ans` is assigned the value 10^15. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + (n - 2), and `i` is `n - 3 + (number of times loop executed)`. `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at the last index of list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, if `t` contains '5' we break out of the loop, the first element of `t` is '0'. After the execution of the loop, it is ensured that at index `i` of list `t`, the value is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `fin` is assigned the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`.
if condition:
```
if (fin > 10 ** 10):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
