Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 1, `t` is a non-empty list, `i` is -1 or the index of the first occurrence of '5' in list `t`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1` and the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5' if `i` is not -1.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 1, `t` is a non-empty list, `i` is -1 or the index of the first occurrence of '5' in list `t`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1` and the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5' if `i` is not -1**
