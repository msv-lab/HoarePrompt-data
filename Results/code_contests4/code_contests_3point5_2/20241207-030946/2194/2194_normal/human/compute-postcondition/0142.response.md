Output State: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a non-empty list. The loop will iterate through the list `t` in reverse order. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5', the loop will break and `i` will be the index of the first occurrence of '5' in the list `t`. If there is no '5' in the list `t`, the loop will finish executing and `i` will be -1.
