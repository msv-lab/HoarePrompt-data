Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeroes; `s` is a string input; `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`; `five`, `two`, `seven` are the counts of '5', '2', '7' respectively in `s; `ans` is updated based on the calculations within the loop; `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions met within the loop; `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans` + 2. If there are at least one '2' and one '5' in the string `s`, the function enters the if block. Inside the if block, `t` is a list created from `s` where elements are shifted to the right, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '2' in the reversed list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of the element at index `i + 1` in list `t`. The first element of list `t` is set to '0' if `n` is 3 or not '0' otherwise. The loop does not execute after the if block. If there is at least one '7' and one '5' in the string `s`, then `fin` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `ans`. If `zero >= 1 and five >= 1`, `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + (n - 2), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2` if `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at the last index of list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, if `t` contains '5' we break out of the loop, `t` is reversed in the end. Additionally, the first element of `t` is '0'. If `n` is equal to 3, `ans` is assigned the value 10^15. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + (n - 2), and `i` is `n - 3 + (number of times loop executed)`. `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at the last index of list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, if `t` contains '5' we break out of the loop, the first element of `t` is '0'. After the execution of the loop, it is ensured that at index `i` of list `t`, the value is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `fin` is assigned the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`.***
