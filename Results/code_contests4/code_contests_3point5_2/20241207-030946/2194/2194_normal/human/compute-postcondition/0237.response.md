Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is assigned to the element at index `j` in list `t`. The initial state indicates that `temp` holds the value at index `j` in list `t`, so the value remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index j in list `t`.
Output State: **`ans` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index j in list `t`**
