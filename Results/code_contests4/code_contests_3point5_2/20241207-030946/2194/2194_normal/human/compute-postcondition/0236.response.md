Example Answer:
The value at index j + 1 in list `t` is assigned the value at index `j`. The initial state mentions that `t` has at least one element '0', so after execution, the value at index j + 1 will be updated to the value at index j. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index j in list `t`.
Output State: **`ans` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at index j in list `t`**
