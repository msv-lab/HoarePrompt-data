Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `s` is a string input, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `five` is the count of '5' in `s`, `two` is the count of '2' in `s`, `seven` is the count of '7' in `s`, `ans` is equal to the number of elements in `t` - 1, `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`, `t` is a list created from the string `s` with elements shifted to the right, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `temp` is assigned the value of the element at index n-1 in list `t`. If the element at index `n-3` in list `t` is '2', then the most internal loop or if statement is exited, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be greater than or equal to -2.***
