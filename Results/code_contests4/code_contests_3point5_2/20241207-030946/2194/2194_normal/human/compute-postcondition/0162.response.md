Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the total number of elements in list `t` - 1, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is n - 2, `j` is -1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. If the element at index `i` in the reversed list `t` is '7', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
