Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeroes; `s` is a string input. If the integer value of `s` is divisible by 25, then no changes occur to the variables. Otherwise, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `five`, `two`, `seven` are counts of '5', '2', '7' respectively in `s`, `ans` is updated based on the calculations within the loop, `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions met within the loop, and `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans` + 2 if `fin` is greater than 10.***
