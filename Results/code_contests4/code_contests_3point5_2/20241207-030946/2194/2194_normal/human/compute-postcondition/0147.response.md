Example Answer:
The element at index `j` in list `t` is assigned the value of `temp`, which is the element at index `j + 1` in list `t`. The element at index `j + 1` in list `t` is a duplicate of the element at index `j`. Therefore, after execution, the list `t` will have the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 1, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is -1 or the index of the first occurrence of '5' in list `t`, `j` is -1 or the index of the first occurrence of '5' in list `t`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1` and the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5' if `i` is not -1, `temp` is the element at index `j + 1` in list `t`.**
