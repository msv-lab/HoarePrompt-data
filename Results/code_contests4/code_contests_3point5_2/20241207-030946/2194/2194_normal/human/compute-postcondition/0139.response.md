According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `t`, and `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a non-empty list, and the element at index `i-1` in list `t` is not '5'. Since the loop is iterating in reverse order, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a non-empty list, the element at index `i-2` in list `t` is not '5' for the loop to execute one more time**
