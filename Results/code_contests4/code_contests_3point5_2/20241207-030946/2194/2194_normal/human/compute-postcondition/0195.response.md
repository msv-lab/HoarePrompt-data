According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `n - 3`. At the end of the previous iteration, n is at least 3, ans is the total number of elements in list t + 1, t is the original list t reversed, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list t if it exists, otherwise -1, j is -1, the first element of t is '0', and n is not equal to 3. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be incremented by 1. So, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
- The loop condition is `i < n - 3`, so to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be equal to `n - 3`.
- Based on the information provided, we know that `n` is not equal to 3, so `n` needs to be incremented by 3.

State: **n is at least 6, ans is the total number of elements in list t + 1, t is the original list t reversed, i is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list t if it exists, otherwise -1, j is -1, the first element of t is '0', and n is not equal to 3**
