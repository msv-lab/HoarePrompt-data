Example Answer:
`t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`. Since `j` is less than `n - 2`, this assignment occurs within the bounds of the list `t`. The value of `t[j]` is now stored in `t[j + 1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `j + 1`, `j` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `temp` is now holding the value of `t[i]`, `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `j + 1`, `j` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `temp` is now holding the value of `t[i]`, `t[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`**
