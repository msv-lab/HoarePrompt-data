According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `i` to `n-1`. So, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`.

For the loop to break if the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5', the element at index `i` in list `t` should be '5'. If there is no '5' in the list `t`, the loop will finish executing and `i` will be -1.

State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a non-empty list, `i` is -1 or the index of the first occurrence of '5' in list `t`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1` and the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5' if `i` is not -1**
