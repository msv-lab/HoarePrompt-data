According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. In this case, `n` is updated to the length of list `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-empty list. Additionally, the loop is iterating in reverse from `n - 1` to 0, so the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `ans` is initialized to 0. 
State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `t` is a non-empty list**
