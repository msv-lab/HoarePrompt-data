Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18 without leading zeroes; `s` is a string input; `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`; `five`, `two`, `seven` are the counts of '5', '2', '7' respectively in `s; `ans` is updated based on the calculations within the loop; `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions met within the loop; `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans`. If the count of '0' in `s` is greater than or equal to 2, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
