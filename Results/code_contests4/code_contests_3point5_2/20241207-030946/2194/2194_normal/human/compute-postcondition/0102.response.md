Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, where `j + 1` equals `i`, therefore `temp` now holds the value of `t[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `j + 1`, `j` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `temp` is now holding the value of `t[i]`, `t[j + 2]` is assigned the value of `t[j]`.**
