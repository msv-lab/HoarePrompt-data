According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 6. Since the loop is `xrange(n - 3)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.
State: **`n` is at least 10, `ans` is the total number of elements in list t + 1, `t` is the original list t reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list t if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1, the first element of t is '0', `n` is not equal to 3, and if t[i] is not equal to '0', then the program state remains unchanged**
