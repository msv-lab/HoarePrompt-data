According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the total number of elements in list `t` - 1, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is n - 2, `j` is -1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse order, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should decrease by 1, and `n` should still be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the total number of elements in list `t` - 1, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is n - 3, `j` is -1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0**
