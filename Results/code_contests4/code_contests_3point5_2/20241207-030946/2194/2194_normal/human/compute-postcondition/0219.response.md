According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `i`, and the value of `t[i]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n - 2`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1, `i` should be `n - 3`, and if `t[i]` is not equal to '0'.
State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 3` for the loop to execute one more time. If `t[i]` is equal to '0', the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement**
