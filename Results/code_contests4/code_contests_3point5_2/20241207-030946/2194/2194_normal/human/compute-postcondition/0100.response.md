According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `j`, `j` is less than `n - 1`. So, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be such that it is less than `n - 2` after increasing it by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `j + 1`, `j` is less than `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`, `t[j + 2]` is assigned the value of `t[j]**
