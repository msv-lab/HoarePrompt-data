Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value at index `j + 1` in list `t`. The previous values of `j` and `t` are known, so `temp` will have the element that was duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 2, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new '5' index, `j` is updated based on the new '5' index, `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 2, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new '5' index, `j` is updated based on the new '5' index, `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
