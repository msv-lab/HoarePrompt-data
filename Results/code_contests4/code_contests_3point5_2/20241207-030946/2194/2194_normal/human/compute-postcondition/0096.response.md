Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial state states that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `i`, and `j` is less than `n - 1`, but the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `i`, `j` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `i`, `j` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1**
