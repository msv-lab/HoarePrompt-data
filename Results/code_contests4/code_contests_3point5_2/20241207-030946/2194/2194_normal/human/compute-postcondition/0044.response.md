Postcondition: ***n is an integer from 1 to 10^18, s is a string input. If the character at index i in s is '0' and zero count is greater than or equal to 2, ans is updated based on the calculation ans += n - 1 - i if cnt is 0. Otherwise, ans is updated based on the calculation ans += n - i - 2 if cnt is 2 or 3. If cnt is 1, then ans is updated based on the calculation ans += n - 2 - i to progress in reverse order. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop will continue in reverse order from i-1 to 0. If t[i] == '0', n is an integer from 1 to 10^18, s is a string input. If cnt is 0, ans is updated by ans += n - 1 - i and cnt is incremented by 1. If cnt is 1, cnt is increased by 1 and the loop breaks out. For any other value of cnt, the program state remains unchanged.***
