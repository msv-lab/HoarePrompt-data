Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in list `t` is updated to the value of `temp`. The initial state provides that `temp` is the value at index `j` in list `t`. Therefore, the value at index `j` in list `t` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`ans` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` is the value at index j in list `t`**
