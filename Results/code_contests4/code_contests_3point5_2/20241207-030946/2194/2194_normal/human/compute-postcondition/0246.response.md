According to the code, the loop executes in reverse order from index `n-2` to 0. The loop continues until `i` reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `ans`, `n`, `i`, `t`, `temp`, `j`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted based on the current value. If the element at index `i` in list `t` is '5', then the loop terminates. If not, then `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to continue to the next iteration.
State: **`ans`, `n`, `i-1`, `t`, `temp`, `j` if t[i] != '5' and `ans`, `n`, `i`, `t`, `temp`, `j` if t[i] == '5'**
