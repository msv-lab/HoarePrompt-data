Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 3, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new '5' index, `j` is updated based on the new '5' index, `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented and `j` is incremented.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 3, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new '5' index, `j` is updated based on the new '5' index, `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented and `j` is incremented**
