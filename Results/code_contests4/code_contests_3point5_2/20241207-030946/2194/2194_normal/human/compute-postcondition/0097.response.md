Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `i`, `j` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `i`, `j` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by 1, `temp` is assigned the value of `t[j + 1]`**
