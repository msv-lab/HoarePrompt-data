Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `ans` is the total number of elements in the list `t`, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list `t` if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1. If the first element of `t` is '0' and `n` is 3, then `ans` is 1000000000000000, `t` is the reversed original list `t`, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list `t` if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1. If the first element of `t` is '0' and `n` is at least 3, then `ans` is the total number of elements in the list `t` + `n` - 2, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list `t` if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1. If the first element of `t` is '0' and `n` is less than 3, then `ans` is the total number of elements in the list `t`, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is the index of the first occurrence of '7' in the original list `t` if it exists, otherwise -1, `j` is -1, and `n` is not equal to 3.***
