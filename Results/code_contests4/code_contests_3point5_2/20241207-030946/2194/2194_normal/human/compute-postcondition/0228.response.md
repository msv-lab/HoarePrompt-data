According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is -1, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` is the value at index j in list `t`. 
To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` should be such that `i` is less than `n - 1`.
State: **`ans` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` is the value at index j in list `t`**
