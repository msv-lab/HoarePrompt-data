Postcondition: ***`ans` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `n - 3`, `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at the last index of list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, if `t` contains '5' we break out of the loop, the first element of `t` is '0', and `n` is not equal to 3, for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, after the execution of the if else block, it is ensured that at index `i` of list `t`, the value is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
