Example Answer:
The element at index `j` in list `t` is assigned the value of `temp`, which is the duplicated element at index `j + 1`. The length of list `t` remains the same, `ans` is 3, `i` and `j` are updated based on the new index '5'. To execute the loop one more time, `i` and `j` are incremented. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 3, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new index '5', `j` is updated based on the new index '5', `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, `i` and `j` are incremented for one more loop execution.
Output State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is 3, `t` has the element at index `j` duplicated and inserted at index `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the new index '5', `j` is updated based on the new index '5', `temp` is the duplicated element at index `j + 1` in list `t`, `i` and `j` are incremented for one more loop execution**
