According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the length of list `t` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `i` is now n - 2, `j` is now -1.
State: **`n` is the length of list `t`, `ans` is the total number of elements in list `t` - 1, `t` is the original list `t` reversed, `i` is n - 2, `j` is -1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
