Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a string input, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `five` is the count of '5' in `s`, `two` is the count of '2' in `s`, `seven` is the count of '7' in `s`, `ans` is equal to the number of elements in `t`, `cnt` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, `fin` is updated to the minimum value between `fin` and `ans` + 2, `t` is a list created from the string `s` with elements shifted to the right, `i` is equal to the index of the first occurrence of '2' in the reversed list `t`, `temp` is assigned the value of the element at index `i + 1` in list `t`. After the execution of the if else block, the first element of list `t` is either '0' if `n` is equal to 3 or not '0' if `n` is not equal to 3. The loop does not execute after the if else block.***
