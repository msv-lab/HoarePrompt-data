Example Answer:
The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18, `s` is a string input, `cnt` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer from 1 to 10^18, `s` is a string input, `cnt` is increased by 1**
