Output State: **`ans` is equal to the number of times the loop executed + (n - 2), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n - 2` if `t` does not contain '5', `t` has at least one element '0', `temp` holds the value at the last index of list `t`, `j` is within the range of indices of list `t`, if `t` contains '5' we break out of the loop, `t` is reversed in the end.**
