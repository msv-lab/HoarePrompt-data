Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to obtain a number that is divisible by 25. It handles all possible cases of swapping adjacent digits to achieve the desired result. The code considers different combinations of digits (0, 5, 2, 7) and calculates the number of moves required for each combination. If it is impossible to obtain a number divisible by 25, the program prints -1. The code also accounts for edge cases such as when the input number is already divisible by 25. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
