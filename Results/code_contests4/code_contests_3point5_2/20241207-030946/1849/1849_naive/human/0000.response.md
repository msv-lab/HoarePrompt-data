Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the number of '(' and ')' characters in the string, as well as the number of '#' characters. It then iterates through the string and replaces each '#' character with the necessary number of ')' characters to make the string beautiful. The program also checks if at any point the number of ')' characters exceeds the number of '(' characters, in which case it prints -1. The output is as expected for all the given examples and the logic of the program is correct.
