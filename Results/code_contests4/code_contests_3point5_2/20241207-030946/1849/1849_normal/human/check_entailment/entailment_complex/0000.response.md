Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads a string from input and then iterates through the characters, updating counts of '(', ')', and '#'. If at any point during the iteration the condition `right > left` is violated, it prints -1 and exits, which aligns with the requirement in the problem description.

Furthermore, the program calculates the number of ')' characters that must replace each '#' character in order to make the string beautiful. The output is the number of ')' characters to replace each '#' character, printed on separate lines.

Overall, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and produces the expected output.
