Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an input string `s` and counts the number of '(', ')', and '#' characters. It then calculates the number of ')' characters needed to replace each '#' based on the counts of '(' and ')' characters. The program iterates through the string, updating the counts of '(' and ')' characters and replacing '#' with the calculated number of ')' characters. If at any point the count of ')' characters exceeds the count of '(' characters, it prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it prints the calculated number of ')' characters for each '#'.

The program ensures that the final string meets the criteria of having no more ')' characters than '(' characters among the first i characters and having an equal total count of '(' and ')' characters. It handles all cases as specified in the problem description.
