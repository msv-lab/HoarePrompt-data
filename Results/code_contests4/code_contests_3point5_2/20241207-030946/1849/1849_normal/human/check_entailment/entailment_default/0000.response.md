Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to output the number of ')' characters that must replace each '#' character in order to form a beautiful string. However, the code does not provide the correct output for some cases.

For example, in the input "((#)((#", the expected output should be "1\n2", indicating that the '#' characters should be replaced with 1 and 2 ')' characters respectively. However, the code may output "-1" for this case, which does not align with the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
