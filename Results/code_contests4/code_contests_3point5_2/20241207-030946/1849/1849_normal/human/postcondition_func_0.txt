The function `func` reads a string `s` from input, processes it by counting the occurrences of '(', ')', and '#'. It then iterates through the characters in `s`, updating the counts accordingly. If at any point during the iteration `right` becomes greater than `left`, the function prints -1 and exits. Finally, the function prints the elements of the list `ans` separated by newlines. The function does not return any specific output based on the input string `s`.
