Output State: **If the loop executes until the end, the final output state will be that `s` is a string of length at least 3 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#', `left` and `right` are integers where `right` is greater than `left`, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements calculated based on the previous counts, `p` is at least 2, `j` is the index of the last character in the string. If `right` is greater than `left` at any point during the loop, the program will print -1 and exit.**
