Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 3 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#', `left` and `right` are integers where `right` is greater than `left`, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements calculated based on the previous counts, `p` is 1 or 2, `j` is 2. If i is '(', `left` is decremented by 1. If i is not '(', `right` is decremented by 1 and `p` becomes 2. If `right` is greater than `left`, then the program immediately terminates.***
