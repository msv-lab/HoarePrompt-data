Example Answer:
The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The value at index `p` in the `ans` list is decreased from the value of `right`. The specific values of `right` and the elements in the `ans` list are unknown, so the output state is: Decrease the value of `right` by the value at index `p` in the `ans` list.
Output State: **Decrease the value of `right` by the value at index `p` in the `ans` list**
