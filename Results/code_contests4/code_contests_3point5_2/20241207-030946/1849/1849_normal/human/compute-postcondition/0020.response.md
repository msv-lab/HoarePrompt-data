Example Answer:
The value of `left` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length at least 2 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#', `left` is decreased by 1, `right` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same based on the value at index `p` in the `ans` list, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements calculated based on the previous counts, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `i` is the second character in the string, and `right` is greater than `left`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#', `left` is decreased by 1, `right` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same based on the value at index `p` in the `ans` list, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements calculated based on the previous counts, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `i` is the second character in the string, and `right` is greater than `left`**
