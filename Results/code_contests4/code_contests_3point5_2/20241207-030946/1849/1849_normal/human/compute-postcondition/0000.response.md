Example Answer:
The lambda function `rstr` is defined to read a line from the standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. Since it is a lambda function, it does not execute immediately. The variable `s` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string of length at least 1 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#'.
Output State: **s is a string of length at least 1 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#'.**
