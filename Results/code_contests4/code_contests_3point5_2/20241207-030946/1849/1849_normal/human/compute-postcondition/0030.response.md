Example Answer:
The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, but it is known that `right` is greater than `left`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `left` will be one less than its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 3 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#', `left` is an integer where `right` is greater than `left`, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements calculated based on the previous counts, `p` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is the third character in the string, `left` is decremented by 1**
