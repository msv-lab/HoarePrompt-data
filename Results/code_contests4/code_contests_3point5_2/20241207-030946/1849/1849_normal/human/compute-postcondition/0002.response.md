Example Answer:
The variables left, right, and sh are assigned the count of '(' , ')' and '#' in the string s respectively. The string s contains only characters '(', ')' and '#', so the count of these characters will be the number of occurrences of each in the string. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string of length at least 1 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#'; left is the count of '(', right is the count of ')', sh is the count of '#'.
Output State: **s is a string of length at least 1 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#'; left is the count of '(', right is the count of ')', sh is the count of '#'**
