Example Answer:
`right` is decremented by the value stored at index `p` in the list `ans`. The values of `right`, `ans`, `p` do not change, as they are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length at least 3 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#', `left` and `right` are integers where `right` is greater than `left`, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements calculated based on the previous counts, `p` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is the third character in the string.
