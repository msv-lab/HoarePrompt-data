Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2 containing only characters '(', ')' and '#', `left` and `right` are integers where `right` is greater than `left`, `sh` is the count of '#', `ans` is a list with elements calculated based on the previous counts, `p` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is the second character in the string. If `right` is greater than `left`, the program executes `print(-1)` and exits.***
