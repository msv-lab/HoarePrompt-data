Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the number of '(' and ')' characters in the input string, as well as the number of '#' characters. It then iterates through the characters in the input string and calculates the number of ')' characters needed to replace each '#' character. The code also checks if at any point the number of ')' characters exceeds the number of '(' characters, in which case it prints -1.

The code handles all potential cases and provides the correct output according to the problem description. There are no identified edge cases where the code does not work as expected.
