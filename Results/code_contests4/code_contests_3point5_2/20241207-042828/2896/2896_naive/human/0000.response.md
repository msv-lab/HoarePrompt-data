Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program reads 6 integers from input and assign them to variables p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b respectively. The program does not perform any additional logic, so it is difficult to find a case where it does not follow the problem description. Since the program simply reads input values and does not manipulate them in any way, it can be considered correct.
