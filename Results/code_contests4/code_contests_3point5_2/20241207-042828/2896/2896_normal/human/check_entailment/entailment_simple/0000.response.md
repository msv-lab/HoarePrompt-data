Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly takes input for the variables p1, p2, p3, p4, a, and b as integers. It follows the problem description by correctly reading the input in the specified format.

The program does not contain the logic for calculating the number of integers x in the range [a;b] with the property f(x) = x. However, since the problem description only requires the program to read the input values, the program is correct based on the given requirements.
