#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input will consist of 6 integers separated by spaces: p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b where 1 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 31415. The numbers p1, p2, p3, p4 will be pairwise distinct.
def func():
    p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads 6 integers from the input separated by spaces: p1, p2, p3, p4, a, b. The function then processes these integers based on the constraints provided. However, the function does not have any explicit return or processing logic beyond reading the input.
