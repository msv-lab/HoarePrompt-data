Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly reads the input values for p1, p2, p3, p4, a, and b using the `map(int, raw_input().split())` method. The program does not perform any further calculations or logic beyond reading the input, so there are no opportunities for it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
