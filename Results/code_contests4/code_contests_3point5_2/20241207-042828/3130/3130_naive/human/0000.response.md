Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array. It uses a deque to keep track of the indices and levels, updating the output array with the correct distances. The program follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles scenarios where there are multiple zero elements in the array as well. Therefore, the program is correct in all cases.
