Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the input array as described in the problem description. It uses a queue to keep track of the indices and levels of zero elements in the array and then iterates through the array to update the distances accordingly. The final output is the sequence of distances which is printed as required.

The program ensures that the distance is correctly calculated for each element in the array, including cases where there are multiple zero elements or when the zero element is at the beginning or end of the array. Therefore, it follows the problem description for all possible cases.
