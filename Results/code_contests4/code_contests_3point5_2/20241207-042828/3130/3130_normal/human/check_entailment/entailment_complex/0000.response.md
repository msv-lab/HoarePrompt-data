Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input array, identifies the positions of zero elements, and then uses a queue to calculate the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array. The final output is the sequence of distances as required by the problem description.

The program ensures that all elements in the output array corresponding to zero values in the input array are updated with the correct distances to the nearest zero. The queue is used to propagate and update these distances efficiently.

Thus, the program consistently follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all cases.
