Example Answer:
A tuple containing the index `i` and the value `0` is appended to the list `que`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `out` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one more element being zero, `out` is a list of -1 repeated n times with at least one more element being zero, `que` contains tuples of indexes and values of zero for each iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one more element being zero, `out` is a list of -1 repeated n times with at least one more element being zero, `que` contains tuples of indexes and values of zero for each iteration of the loop**
