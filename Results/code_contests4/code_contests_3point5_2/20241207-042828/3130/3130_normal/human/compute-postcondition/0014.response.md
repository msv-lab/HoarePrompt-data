Example Answer:
`ix, lev` are assigned the values dequeued from the queue `que`. The values of `ix` and `lev` will be the first pair of values dequeued from the queue. The initial state mentions that there is at least one zero element in array `a` which hasn't been processed yet, so the `que` would have elements to dequeue. Since we do not have information about the specific values in the queue, we can only state that the values of `ix` and `lev` will be the first pair of values dequeued.
Output State: **`ix, lev` are the first pair of values dequeued from the queue `que`**
