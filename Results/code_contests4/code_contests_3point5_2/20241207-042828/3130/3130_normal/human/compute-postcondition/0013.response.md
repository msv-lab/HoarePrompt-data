According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `que` list is not empty. Right before the loop, `que` contains tuples of indexes and values of zero for each zero element in array `a`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one zero element in array `a` which hasn't been processed yet.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one being zero, `out` is a list where the elements corresponding to zero values in array `a` are updated to zero, for the loop to execute the first time, there must be at least one zero element in array `a` which hasn't been processed yet**
