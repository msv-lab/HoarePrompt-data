Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least two being zero, `out` is a list of -1 repeated n times, `que` contains tuples of indexes and values of zero for each iteration of the loop. If the element at index `i` in array `a` is zero, then the corresponding index in `out` is updated to zero. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
