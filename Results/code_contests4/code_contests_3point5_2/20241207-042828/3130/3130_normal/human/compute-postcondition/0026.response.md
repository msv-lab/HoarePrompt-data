Example Answer: 
The value of `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`, but the previous values of `ix` and `lev` are unknown. Therefore, after execution, `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`. The loop continues until the queue `que` is empty. 
Output State: **The values of `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`, the loop continues until `que` is empty.**
