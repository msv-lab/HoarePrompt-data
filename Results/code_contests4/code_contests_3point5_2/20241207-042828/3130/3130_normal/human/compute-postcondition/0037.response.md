Example Answer:
The tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`. The value of `ix` is decreased by 1, and the value of `lev` is increased by 1. Therefore, after execution, the queue `que` will have a new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`.
Output State: **`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`. If 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, a tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`. The queue `que` will have a new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)`**
