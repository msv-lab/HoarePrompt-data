Example Answer:
`out[ix]` is assigned the value `lev`. The value of `ix` and `lev` are the first pair of values dequeued from the queue `que`, and the value of `out[ix]` is not -1. After execution, the value of `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix, lev` are the first pair of values dequeued from the queue `que`, the value of `out[ix]` is not -1, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`.
Output State: **`ix, lev` are the first pair of values dequeued from the queue `que`, the value of `out[ix]` is not -1, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`**
