Example Answer:
`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, and `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`. Then, a tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`, a tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`.
Output State: **`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`, a tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`**
