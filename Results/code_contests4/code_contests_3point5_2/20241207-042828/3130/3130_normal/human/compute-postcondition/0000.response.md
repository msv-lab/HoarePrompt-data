Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Then, the array `a` is assigned a list of integers by splitting the input values. At least one element in the array `a` is zero. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, array a contains n integer elements with at least one element being zero.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, array a contains n integer elements with at least one element being zero**
