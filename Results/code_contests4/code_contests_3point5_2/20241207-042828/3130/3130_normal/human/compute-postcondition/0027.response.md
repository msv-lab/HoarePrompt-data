Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` to the queue `que`. This means the values of `ix` and `lev` are incremented by 1 and added to the queue. The loop will continue until the queue `que` is empty. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`, the loop continues until `que` is empty and new values `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` are appended to the queue.
Output State: **The values of `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`, the loop continues until `que` is empty and new values `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` are appended to the queue.**
