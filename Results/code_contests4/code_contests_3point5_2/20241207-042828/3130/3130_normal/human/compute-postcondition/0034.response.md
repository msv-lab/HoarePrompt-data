Example Answer:
`out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`, where `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`. The values of `ix` and `lev` are not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, and `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`.
Output State: **`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, and `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`**
