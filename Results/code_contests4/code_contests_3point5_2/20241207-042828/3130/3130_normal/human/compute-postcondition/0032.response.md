According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the queue `que` is not empty. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
1. `ix` and `lev` need to be dequeued from the queue `que`.
2. `out[ix]` needs to be updated to `lev`.
3. If `out[ix] != -1` and `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, new values `(ix - 1, lev - 1)` need to be appended to the queue.

State: **`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`, if `out[ix] != -1` and `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, new values `(ix - 1, lev - 1)` are appended to the queue for the loop to execute again**
