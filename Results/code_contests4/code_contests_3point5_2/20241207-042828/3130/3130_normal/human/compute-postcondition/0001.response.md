Example Answer:
The list `out` is initialized with -1 repeated n times, and `que` is initialized as an empty deque. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, array a contains n integer elements with at least one element being zero, out is a list of -1 repeated n times, que is an empty deque.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, array a contains n integer elements with at least one element being zero, out is a list of -1 repeated n times, que is an empty deque**
