According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the queue `que` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions specified are that `ix, lev` are the first pair of values dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is not -1 and is updated to `lev + 1`, `ix + 1` is within the range of 0 to n-1, and if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1, `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `que` should not be empty
- The conditions for `ix, lev, n, que, out` must still hold true for the next iteration.

State: **`ix, lev, n, que, out` are such that `ix, lev` are the first pair of values dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is not -1 and is updated to `lev + 1`. Additionally, `ix + 1` is within the range of 0 to n-1, and if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1, `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`, and que is not empty for the loop to execute again**
