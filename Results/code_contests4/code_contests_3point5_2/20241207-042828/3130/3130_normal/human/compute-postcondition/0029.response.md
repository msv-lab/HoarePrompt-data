Example Answer:
`(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue. The states of variables `ix`, `lev`, `out[ix]`, and `n` are not affected. The loop continues until the queue is empty. Additionally, if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, new values `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` are appended to the queue.
Output State: **`ix`, `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev`, the loop continues until `que` is empty. Additionally, if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, new values `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` are appended to the queue.**
