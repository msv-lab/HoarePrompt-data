Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(i, 0)` to the list `que`. This means that the index `i` and the value 0 are added as a tuple to the `que` list. Since the loop is executing and at least two elements in array `a` are zero, the `que` list will continue to grow with tuples containing indexes and values of zero.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, array `a` contains n integer elements with at least two elements being zero, `out` is a list of -1 repeated n times, `que` contains tuples of indexes and values of zero for each iteration of the loop**
