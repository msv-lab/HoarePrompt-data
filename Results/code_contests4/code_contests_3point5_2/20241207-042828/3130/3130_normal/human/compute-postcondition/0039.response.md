Postcondition: ***`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`. If `out[ix]` is not equal to -1, then `out[ix]` is assigned the value of `lev`. Additionally, if 0 <= ix + 1 <= n - 1, then a tuple `(ix + 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`. Finally, after the execution of the if statement, the queue `que` will have a new tuple `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` added to it.***
