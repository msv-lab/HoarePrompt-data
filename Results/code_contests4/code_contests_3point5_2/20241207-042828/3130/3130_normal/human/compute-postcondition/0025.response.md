Example Answer:
The values of `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`. The value of `out[ix]` is updated to `lev + 1`. If `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` satisfies the conditions, it is appended to the queue `que`. The loop continues as long as `que` is not empty.
Output State: **The values of `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is updated to `lev + 1`, the loop continues as long as `que` is not empty.**
