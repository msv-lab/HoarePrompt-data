Example Answer:
`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`. If `out[ix]` is not equal to -1 and `0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1`, then `out[ix]` is updated to `lev` and new values `(ix - 1, lev - 1)` are appended to the queue for further execution. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, with further modifications based on the conditions.
Output State: **`ix` and `lev` are dequeued from the queue `que`, with further modifications based on the conditions**
