Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` contains n integer elements with at least one more element being zero, `out` is a list of -1 repeated n times with at least one more element being zero, `que` contains tuples of indexes and values of zero for each iteration of the loop. If `a[i]` is false, there is no change in the variables.***
