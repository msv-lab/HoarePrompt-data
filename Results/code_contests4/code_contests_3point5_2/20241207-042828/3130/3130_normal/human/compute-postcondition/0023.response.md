Postcondition: ***`ix, lev, n, que, out` are such that `ix, lev` are the first pair of values dequeued from the queue `que`, `out[ix]` is not -1 and is updated to `lev + 1`. Additionally, `ix + 1` is within the range of 0 to n-1, and if 0 <= ix - 1 <= n - 1, `(ix - 1, lev + 1)` is appended to the queue `que`.***
