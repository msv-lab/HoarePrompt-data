Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integer elements. It then processes the array to update specific elements based on certain conditions. The function does not explicitly return any value but prints the updated array `out` where elements corresponding to zero values in array `a` are replaced with level values calculated based on the position of zeros in the array. The function utilizes a queue `que` to track and update the levels of zero elements in the array.**
