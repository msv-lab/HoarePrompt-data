Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly finds the distance to the nearest zero for each element in the array as described in the problem statement. It uses a deque to efficiently keep track of the elements to traverse. The logic of updating the distances and adding adjacent elements to the queue is correctly implemented. The program handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
