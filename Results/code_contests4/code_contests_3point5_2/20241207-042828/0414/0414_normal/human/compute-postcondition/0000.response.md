Example Answer:
The length of the sequence is calculated using the `len()` function and assigned to the variable `length`. The value of `length` depends on the input sequence, so it can vary. Therefore, the Output State is: sequence is a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroach and red cockroach respectively. oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches. `length` is the length of the input sequence.
Output State: **sequence is a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroach and red cockroach respectively. oddchar and evenchar are characters representing the colors of cockroaches. `length` is the length of the input sequence**
