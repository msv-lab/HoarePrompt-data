Postcondition: ***`length` is the length of input sequence, `oddmisplaced` is 1, `evenmisplaced` is 2, `sequence` has a length of at least 1, `i` is 1, `oddchar` and `evenchar` represent the colors of the cockroaches. If i is an even number and sequence[i] is not equal to evenchar, then the number of even misplaced cockroaches increases by 1.***
