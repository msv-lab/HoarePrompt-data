Example Answer:
`oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `oddmisplaced` is 1, so after execution, `oddmisplaced` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `length` is the length of input sequence, `oddmisplaced` is 2, `evenmisplaced` is 2, `sequence` has a length of at least 1, `i` is 1, `oddchar` and `evenchar` represent the colors of the cockroaches.
Output State: **`length` is the length of input sequence, `oddmisplaced` is 2, `evenmisplaced` is 2, `sequence` has a length of at least 1, `i` is 1, `oddchar` and `evenchar` represent the colors of the cockroaches.**
