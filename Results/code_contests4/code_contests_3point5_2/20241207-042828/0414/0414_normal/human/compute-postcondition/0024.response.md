The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `sequence`, `oddchar`, and `evenchar`. `sequence` is a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroach and red cockroach respectively. `oddchar` and `evenchar` are characters representing the colors of cockroaches. After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of the minimum value between the number of even cockroaches misplaced and the number of odd cockroaches misplaced, and the absolute difference between the number of even cockroaches misplaced and the number of odd cockroaches misplaced. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sequence of cockroaches, along with characters representing odd and even cockroaches, and calculate the sum and absolute difference of misplaced cockroaches based on their colors.
