Postcondition: ***`length` is the length of input sequence, `oddmisplaced` is 1, `evenmisplaced` is 1, `sequence` has a length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `oddchar` and `evenchar` represent the colors of the cockroaches. If `i` is even and the color of the cockroach at index `i` in the sequence is not equal to `evenchar`, then `evenmisplaced` is incremented by 1. If `i` is odd and the color of the cockroach at index `i` in the sequence is not equal to `oddchar`, then `oddmisplaced` is incremented by 1.***
