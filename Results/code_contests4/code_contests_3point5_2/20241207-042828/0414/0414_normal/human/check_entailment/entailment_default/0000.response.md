Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a sequence of cockroaches, an odd character, and an even character as input, and calculates the number of misplaced odd and even cockroaches in the sequence. 
- The function then returns the sum of the minimum value between the number of even cockroaches misplaced and the number of odd cockroaches misplaced, along with the absolute difference between them.
- The main program reads the input, calculates the minimum number of moves Anatoly needs to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate, and prints the result.
- The code seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate. 
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
