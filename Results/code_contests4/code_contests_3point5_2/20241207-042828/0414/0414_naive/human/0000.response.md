Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves Anatoly needs to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate. It considers both swapping two cockroaches and changing the color of a single cockroach as valid moves. The function `func_1` iterates through the sequence of cockroaches, counts the number of misplaced cockroaches for both odd and even positions, and then calculates the minimum number of swaps and color changes required. The program then takes the minimum of the results obtained by considering 'r' as odd color and 'b' as even color, and vice versa. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output.
