Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly implements a Trie data structure to store and search for words from the input strings.
2. The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on whether the first player can win, the second player can win, or both can win.
3. The program correctly handles the cases where the first player wins, the second player wins, or the game ends in a draw.
4. The program uses recursive functions to traverse the Trie and determine the winning strategy for each player.
5. The program correctly reads input, builds the Trie, and outputs the winner based on the game logic.
