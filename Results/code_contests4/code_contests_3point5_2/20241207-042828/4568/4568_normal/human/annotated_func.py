#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `node` and `level`, where each string in the group is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function recursively traverses a tree structure represented by `node` and determines if there are children nodes with specific properties. It returns True, False if the initial `node` is not None and is a word, False, True if the level is odd, and True if there exists at least one child node with odd_w as True, and True if there exists at least one child node with even_w as True.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a parameter `ttree` and iterates over its child nodes. It then calls another function `func_1` on each child node, setting `odd_w` and `even_w` based on the return values. If any child has `even_w` as True, `canwin` is set to True, and if any child has `odd_w` as True, `canloss` is set to True. The function returns different integer values based on specific conditions: 3 if both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, 1 if only `canloss` is True, and 2 otherwise.
