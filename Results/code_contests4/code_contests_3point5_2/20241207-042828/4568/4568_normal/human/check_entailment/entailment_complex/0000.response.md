Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` analyze the tree structure of the strings, but they do not implement the game logic described in the problem. The game involves two players taking turns adding a single letter to the word, with the word having to be a prefix of at least one string from the group. However, the functions in the code do not simulate this game-playing behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the game-playing logic as specified.
