You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with strings for two players.

Given a group of n non-empty strings. During the game two players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players move in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the word, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group. A player loses if he cannot move.

Andrew and Alex decided to play this game k times. The player who is the loser of the i-th game makes the first move in the (i + 1)-th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player who wins the last (k-th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor wants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.

Input

The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Each of the next n lines contains a single non-empty string from the given group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed 105. Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.

Output

If the player who moves first wins, print "First", otherwise print "Second" (without the quotes).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers. Each string in the group is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters.**
def func_1(node, level):
    if (node is not None and node.isWord) :
        if (level % 2 == 1) :
            return True, False
            #The program returns True, False
        else :
            return False, True
            #The program returns False, True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers. Each string in the group is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters. node is either None or node.isWord is False.
    nodes = node.childs
    odd_ret = False
    even_ret = False
    for it in nodes:
        child = nodes.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, level + 1)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_ret = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_ret = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `odd_ret` and `even_ret` are booleans. After the loop executes, `odd_ret` will be True if there exists at least one `child` with `odd_w` as True in the `nodes` dictionary. `even_ret` will be True if there exists at least one `child` with `even_w` as True in the `nodes` dictionary.
    return odd_ret, even_ret
    #The program returns odd_ret as True if there exists at least one child with odd_w as True in the nodes dictionary and even_ret as True if there exists at least one child with even_w as True in the nodes dictionary
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `node` and `level`, where each string in the group is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function recursively traverses a tree structure represented by `node` and determines if there are children nodes with specific properties. It returns True, False if the initial `node` is not None and is a word, False, True if the level is odd, and True if there exists at least one child node with odd_w as True, and True if there exists at least one child node with even_w as True.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(ttree):
    canloss = False
    canwin = False
    node = ttree.root.childs
    for it in node:
        child = node.get(it)
        
        odd_w, even_w = func_1(child, 0)
        
        if odd_w == True:
            odd_w = True
        
        if even_w == True:
            even_w = True
        
        if even_w:
            canwin = True
        
        if odd_w:
            canloss = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `canloss` and `canwin` are boolean values. `canloss` is True if any odd_w is True, `canwin` is True if any even_w is True. `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the last element in `node`, `child` is the last child node in `node`, `odd_w` is True, `even_w` is True.
    if (canloss and canwin) :
        return 3
        #The program returns 3
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`canloss` and `canwin` are boolean values. `canloss` is True if any odd_w is True, `canwin` is True if any even_w is True. `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the last element in `node`, `child` is the last child node in `node`, `odd_w` is True, `even_w` is True, and (canloss and canwin) is False
    if canloss :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`canloss` and `canwin` are boolean values. `canloss` is True if any odd_w is True, `canwin` is True if any even_w is True. `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the last element in `node`, `child` is the last child node in `node`, `odd_w` is True, `even_w` is True, and (canloss and canwin) is False. The condition (canloss) is False
    return 2
    #The program returns the integer 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a parameter `ttree` and iterates over its child nodes. It then calls another function `func_1` on each child node, setting `odd_w` and `even_w` based on the return values. If any child has `even_w` as True, `canwin` is set to True, and if any child has `odd_w` as True, `canloss` is set to True. The function returns different integer values based on specific conditions: 3 if both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, 1 if only `canloss` is True, and 2 otherwise.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
