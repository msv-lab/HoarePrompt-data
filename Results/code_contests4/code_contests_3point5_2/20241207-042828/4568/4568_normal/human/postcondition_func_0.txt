The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `node` and `level`, where each string in the group is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters. The function recursively traverses a tree structure represented by `node` and determines if there are children nodes with specific properties. It returns True, False if the initial `node` is not None and is a word, False, True if the level is odd, and True if there exists at least one child node with odd_w as True, and True if there exists at least one child node with even_w as True.
