Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a parameter `ttree` and iterates over its child nodes. It then calls another function `func_1` on each child node, setting `odd_w` and `even_w` based on the return values. If any child has `even_w` as True, `canwin` is set to True, and if any child has `odd_w` as True, `canloss` is set to True. The function returns different integer values based on specific conditions: 3 if both `canloss` and `canwin` are True, 1 if only `canloss` is True, and 2 otherwise.**
