According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `node`. If the `node` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `canloss` is False and `canwin` is False do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to stay the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `node` must have at least 1 element and `it` is the first element in `node`.
State: **`canloss` is False, `canwin` is False, `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the first element in `node`**
