Postcondition: ***`canloss` is False, `canwin` is True, `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the first element, `child` is the first child node in `node`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are returned values from `func_1(child, 0)`. If `odd_w` is True, then the program state remains unchanged. If `even_w` is True, then the program state remains unchanged and `even_w` is True.***
