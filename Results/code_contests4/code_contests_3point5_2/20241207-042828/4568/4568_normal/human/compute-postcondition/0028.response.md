Postcondition: ***`canloss`, `canwin` are boolean values. If `odd_w` is True, then `canloss` is True, `canwin` is True, `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the second element in `node`, `child` is the first child node in `node`, `odd_w` is True, `even_w` is True. If `even_w` is True, the program retains the initial state without any changes.***
