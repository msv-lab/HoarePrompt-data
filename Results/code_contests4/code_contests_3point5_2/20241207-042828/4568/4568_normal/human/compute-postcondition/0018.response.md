According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `node` and `it`. If there are more elements in `node`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `canloss` is False, `canwin` is True, `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the first element, `child` is the first child node in `node`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are returned values from `func_1(child, 0)`. If `odd_w` is True, then the program state remains unchanged. If `even_w` is True, then the program state remains unchanged and `even_w` is True. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `node` should be assigned to `it`.
State: **`canloss` is False, `canwin` is True, `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the second element in `node`, `child` is the first child node in `node`, `odd_w` and `even_w` are returned values from `func_1(child, 0)`**
