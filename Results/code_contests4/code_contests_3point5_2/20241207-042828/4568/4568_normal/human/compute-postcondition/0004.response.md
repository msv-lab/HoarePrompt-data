Example Answer:
`child` is assigned the value of `node.get(it)`. Since `it` is the first element in `node`, `child` will be assigned the value of the first child node in `node`. The variables `canloss` and `canwin` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `canloss` is False, `canwin` is False, `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the first element, `child` is the first child node in `node`.
Output State: **`canloss` is False, `canwin` is False, `node` has at least 1 element, `it` is the first element, `child` is the first child node in `node`**
