Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. The implementation of the Trie data structure and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be incorrect. There are issues in the traversal logic of the Trie, as well as in determining the winning and losing conditions based on the game rules.

Example where the code does not work as expected:
Input:
```
2 2
ab
ba
```
Expected Output: Second

Explanation: In this case, the player who moves first should lose, but the code may not handle this situation correctly due to incorrect traversal logic.
