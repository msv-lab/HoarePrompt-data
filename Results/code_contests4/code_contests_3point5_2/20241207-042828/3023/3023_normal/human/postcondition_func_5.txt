The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `solution` and `inputs_answers`. It iterates through the inputs and corresponding expected outputs in `inputs_answers`, calls `solution` with the inputs, compares the output with the expected value, and prints whether the test passed or failed. The function does not have a specific return value, as it is focused on verifying the correctness of the provided solution for a given problem.
