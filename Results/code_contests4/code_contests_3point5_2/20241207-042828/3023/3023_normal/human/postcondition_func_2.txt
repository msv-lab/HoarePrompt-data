The function `score` accepts two parameters `p` and `q`. It iterates through the elements in `balls`, calculates new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on `p` and `q`, then checks if `ny` is not in the list corresponding to `nx` in `bdict`. The function returns the count of occurrences where `ny` is not in the list corresponding to `nx` in `bdict` for all elements in `balls`.
