The function func_8 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in args, writing them to the file specified in kwargs or to sys.stdout by default. It uses the separator specified in kwargs or a space by default. It then writes the end character specified in kwargs or a newline by default. If the flush key in kwargs is True, it flushes the file. The function does not have return values but performs output operations based on the provided arguments.
