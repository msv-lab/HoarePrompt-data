Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts two parameters, n and balls. It constructs a dictionary bdict from the elements in the balls list. Then, it iterates through all pairs of points in the balls list, calculates the score based on their differences, and keeps track of the minimum score found. The function returns this minimum score. The code does not explicitly define the data type for parameter n, leading to potential ambiguity. Additionally, it relies on a score function that is not provided in the code.**
