Example Answer:
The code writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. The previous values of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args`, `x` are known, but since only `file` is directly affected by the code, the output state is: `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args` remain unchanged, `x` is written to `file`.
Output State: **`sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args` remain unchanged, `x` is written to `file**.
