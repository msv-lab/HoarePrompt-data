Output State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, if ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`, if `points` is less than `ans`, the overall state of the program remains the same after the if else block execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1, `p` is assigned the difference of balls[j][0] and balls[i][0], `q` is assigned the difference of balls[j][1] and balls[i][1]**
