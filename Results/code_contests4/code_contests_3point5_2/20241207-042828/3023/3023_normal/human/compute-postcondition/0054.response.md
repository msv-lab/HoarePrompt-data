Output State: **`ans` is now assigned the value of `points`, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked along with the newly added pair (-p, -q), `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, if ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`, `points` is the result of calling the `score` function with the arguments `p` and `q, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1, `p` is assigned the difference of balls[j][0] and balls[i][0], `q` is assigned the difference of balls[j][1] and balls[i][1.**
