Postcondition: ***`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`. If `points` is less than `ans`, the overall state of the program remains the same after the if else block execution.***
