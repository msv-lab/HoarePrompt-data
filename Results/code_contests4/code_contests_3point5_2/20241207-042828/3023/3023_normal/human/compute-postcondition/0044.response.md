Example Answer:
`points` is assigned the result of the function `score(p, q)`. The function `score` is called with the values of `p` and `q`. The variables `ans`, `tried`, `p`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, and ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`.
Output State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, and ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`.**
