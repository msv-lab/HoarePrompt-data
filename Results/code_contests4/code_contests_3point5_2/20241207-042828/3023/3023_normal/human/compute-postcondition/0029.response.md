According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `p`, `q`, `tried`, `points`, and `ans`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `p` and `q` are differences between elements of 'balls[j]' and 'balls[i]'. If `(p, q)` is not in `tried` and `tried` contains the tuple `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`, then `score(p, q)` is executed and `points` is assigned the return value. If `points` is less than `ans`, the loop continues executing for the next iteration.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `i`, `p`, `q`, `tried`, `points`, and `ans` need to be updated based on the actions taken in the loop body during the previous iteration. 

State: **At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `i`, `p`, `q`, `tried`, `points`, and `ans` have been modified accordingly based on the loop body execution.**
