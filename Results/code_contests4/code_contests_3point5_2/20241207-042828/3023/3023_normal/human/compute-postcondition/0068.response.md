Example Answer:
The differences between the x and y coordinates of the j-th and i-th balls are calculated and assigned to variables p and q. The values of p and q are dependent on the positions of the j-th and i-th balls. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-1`.
Output State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-1**.
