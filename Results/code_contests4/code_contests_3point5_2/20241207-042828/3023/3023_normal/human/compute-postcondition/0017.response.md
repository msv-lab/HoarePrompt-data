Example Answer:
The value of `x` is converted to a string using `str(x)`, and then this string is written to the `file`. The variables `sep`, `args`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep`, `file`, `args` remain unchanged, `at_start` is False, the next element in `args` is assigned to `x`, and the string representation of `x` is written to the `file`.
Output State: **`sep`, `file`, `args` remain unchanged, `at_start` is False, the next element in `args` is assigned to `x`, and the string representation of `x` is written to the `file`**
