Postcondition: ***`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations along with the newly added pair, `p` holds the difference of balls[j][0] and balls[i][0], `q` holds the difference of balls[j][1] and balls[i][1], `i` is less than `n+1`, and `i` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`. `points` is the result of calling the `score` function with the arguments `p` and `q. If points is less than `ans`, `ans` is updated to the value of `points` while the other variables retain their original values.***
