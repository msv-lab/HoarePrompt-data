Example Answer: 
`points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`, where `p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`. Additionally, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`. The calculation of `points` is dependent on how `score(p, q)` is implemented, so the exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific function. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`, and `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`, and `points` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`**
