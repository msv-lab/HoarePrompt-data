Example Answer:
The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned using the `pop` method on the `kwargs` dictionary. If the 'sep' key exists in `kwargs`, `sep` will be assigned that value, otherwise, it will default to ' '. Similarly, if the 'file' key exists in `kwargs`, `file` will be assigned that value, otherwise, it will default to `sys.stdout`. The initial state does not provide the values of `sep`, `file`, or `kwargs`, so the output state is: `sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `pop` method applied on `kwargs`.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `pop` method applied on `kwargs`**
