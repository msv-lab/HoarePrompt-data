Example Answer:
The function `score(p, q)` is called with arguments `p` and `q`, and the return value is stored in the variable `points`. The values of `p` and `q` are stored in the variable `tried`, and `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `i+1`. The minimum score is stored in `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-2`, `points` contains the score returned by the function, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be less than `i+1.
