Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the value of `balls[j][0] - balls[i][0]` and `q` is assigned the value of `balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `tried` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`**
