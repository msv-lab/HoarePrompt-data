Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which means it remains the same as before. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep`, `file`, `args` remain unchanged, `at_start` is False, the next element in `args` is assigned to `x`, and the string representation of `x` is written to the `file`.
Output State: **`sep`, `file`, `args` remain unchanged, `at_start` is False, the next element in `args` is assigned to `x`, and the string representation of `x` is written to the `file`**
