Example Answer:
The value of `at_start` is assigned as `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args` remain unchanged, `x` is written to `file`, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args` remain unchanged, `x` is written to `file`, `at_start` is False**
