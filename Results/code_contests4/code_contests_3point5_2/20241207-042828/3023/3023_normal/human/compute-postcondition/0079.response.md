Example Answer:
The pair `(p, q)` is added to the set `tried`. The variables `ans`, `i`, `n`, `(-p, -q)`, and `points` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-2`, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` contains the score returned by the function.
