The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `balls`. The parameter `n` is not explicitly defined in the constraints, so it can be assumed to be any data type. The parameter `balls` is a list of elements. The program calculates the minimum score by using the 'score' function for all pairs of differences between elements in the 'balls' list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters, `n` and `balls`, and return the minimum score calculated by the 'score' function for all pairs of differences between elements in the 'balls' list.
