According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `args`. If args is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `pop` method applied on `kwargs`, and `at_start` is True. For the loop to execute, `args` must not be empty, and `x` should be the first element in `args`.
State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `pop` method applied on `kwargs`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is not empty, and `x` is the first element in `args`**
