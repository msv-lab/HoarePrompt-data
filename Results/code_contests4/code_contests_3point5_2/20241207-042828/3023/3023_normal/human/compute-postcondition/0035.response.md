Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`, and `ans` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. If `points` is less than `ans`, then the function updates `p` and `q`, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`, and `ans` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`.***
