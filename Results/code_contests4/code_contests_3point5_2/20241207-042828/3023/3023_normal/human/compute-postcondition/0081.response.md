Example Answer:
The function `score(p, q)` is called with arguments `p` and `q`, which are the last calculated differences. The return value is stored in the variable `points`. The initial state does not provide the values of `p` and `q`, so the output state is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-2`, `points` contains the score returned by the function.
Output State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-2`, `points` contains the score returned by the function**
