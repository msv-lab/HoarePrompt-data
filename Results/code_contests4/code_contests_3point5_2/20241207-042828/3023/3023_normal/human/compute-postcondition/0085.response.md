According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0 and `n` is at most `i-2`. Also, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, and if `(p, q)` is not in `tried` and `points` is less than `ans`, the state remains the same as the precondition. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `i+1`.
State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-2`, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` contains the score returned by the function, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be less than `i+1**.
