Example Answer: 
The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value True. The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `pop` method applied on `kwargs`, but the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `pop` method applied on `kwargs`, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `pop` method applied on `kwargs`, `at_start` is True**
