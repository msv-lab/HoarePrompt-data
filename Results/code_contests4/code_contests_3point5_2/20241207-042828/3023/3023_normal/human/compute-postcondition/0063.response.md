Postcondition: ***`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations along with the newly added pair, `p` holds the difference of balls[j][0] and balls[i][0], `q` holds the difference of balls[j][1] and balls[i][1], `i` is less than `n+1`, and `i` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If points is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `points` while the other variables remain unchanged.***
