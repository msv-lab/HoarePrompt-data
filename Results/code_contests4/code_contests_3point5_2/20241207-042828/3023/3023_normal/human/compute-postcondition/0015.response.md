Example Answer: 
The `write` method of the `file` object writes the value of `sep` to the file. The variables `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged. The next element in `args` needs to be assigned to `x`, and `at_start` remains False. 
Output State: **`sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args` remain unchanged, next element in `args` needs to be assigned to `x`, `at_start` is False**
