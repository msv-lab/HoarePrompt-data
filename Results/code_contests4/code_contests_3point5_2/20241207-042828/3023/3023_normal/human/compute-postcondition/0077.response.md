According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is less than `i-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-1`, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` contains the score returned by the function. If `points` is less than `ans`, `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` remains greater than 0, `n` should be less than `i-1`.
State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-2`, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` contains the score returned by the function**.
