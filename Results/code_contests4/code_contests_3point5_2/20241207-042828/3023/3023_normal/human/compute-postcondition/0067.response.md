Since the loop will iterate `i` times, the loop can execute if `i` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to or greater than `n+1`, which means `n` can be at most `i-1`. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `i` to be greater than 0 and `n` to be at most `i-1`.
State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-1`**.
