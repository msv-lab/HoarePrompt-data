Example Answer:
The pair `(p, q)` is added to the set `tried`. The values of `p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`. The specific values of `p` and `q` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, and `(p, q)` is added to the set `tried`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, and `(p, q)` is added to the set `tried`**
