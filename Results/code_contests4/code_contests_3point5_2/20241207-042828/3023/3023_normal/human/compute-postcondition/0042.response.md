Example Answer:
The pair (p, q) is added to the set `tried`. This ensures that the pair is marked as checked to avoid redundant calculations. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, and ((p, q) not in tried).
Output State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, and ((p, q) not in tried)**
