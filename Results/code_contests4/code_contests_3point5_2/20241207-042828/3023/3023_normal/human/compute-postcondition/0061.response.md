Example Answer:
The function `score(p, q)` is called with the values of `p` and `q`, and the result is stored in `points`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `ans` and `tried`. If `points` is less than the current value of `ans`, `ans` is updated with the value of `points`, and the pair (-p, -q) is added to the `tried` set. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations along with the newly added pair, `p` holds the difference of balls[j][0] and balls[i][0], `q` holds the difference of balls[j][1] and balls[i][1], `i` is less than `n+1`, and `i` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
