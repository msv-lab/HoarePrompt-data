Postcondition: ***`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-2`, `points` contains the score returned by the function, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be less than `i+1. If `points` is less than `ans`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `points`.***
