Example Answer: 
The function `score(p, q)` is called with the values of `p` and `q`. The output of the function will be stored in the variable `points`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-1`, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, and `points` contains the score returned by the function.
