Example Answer:
`(-p, -q)` is added to the set `tried`. Since `p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, the negative values of `p` and `q` are added to the set `tried`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`**
