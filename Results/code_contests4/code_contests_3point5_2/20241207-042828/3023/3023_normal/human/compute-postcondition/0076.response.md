Postcondition: ***`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains unique pairs of differences and their negations including `(p, q)`, `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences, `i` is greater than 0, `n` is at most `i-1`, `(-p, -q)` is added to `tried`, `points` contains the score returned by the function. If `points` is less than `ans`, `ans` is assigned the value of `points` and the other variables maintain their previous states.***
