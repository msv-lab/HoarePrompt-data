Postcondition: ***`p` and `q` are differences between elements of 'balls[j]' and 'balls[i]'. If `(p, q)` is not in `tried` and `tried` contains the tuple `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`, then the function `score(p, q)` is executed and `points` is assigned the return value. If `points` is less than `ans`, the function continues executing.***
