Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`. The values of `p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`. The array `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`, `ans` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`.
Output State: **`p` and `q` are updated based on the coordinates of balls `i` and `j`, `tried` contains `(-p, -q)`, `ans` is assigned the value returned by the function `score(p, q)`**
