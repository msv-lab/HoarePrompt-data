Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `points`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`, points is less than `ans`.
Output State: **`ans` contains the minimum score, `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked, `p` holds the last calculated difference, `q` holds the last calculated difference, `i` is less than `n`, ((p, q) not in tried), the pair (-p, -q) is added to `tried`, points is less than `ans`**
