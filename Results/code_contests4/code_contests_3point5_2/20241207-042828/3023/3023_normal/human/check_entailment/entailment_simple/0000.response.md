Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. The program reads the input, calculates the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by optimally choosing p and q, and then outputs the result. The functions defined in the program handle the logic of calculating the cost and determining the optimal values of p and q.

The program iterates over all possible pairs of differences between the coordinates of the balls, calculates the cost of collecting all balls for each pair, and keeps track of the minimum cost. The `score` function determines the number of times a ball can be collected based on the chosen p and q values.

Overall, the program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible cases within the constraints specified.
