You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N balls in a two-dimensional plane. The i-th ball is at coordinates (x_i, y_i).

We will collect all of these balls, by choosing two integers p and q such that p \neq 0 or q \neq 0 and then repeating the following operation:

* Choose a ball remaining in the plane and collect it. Let (a, b) be the coordinates of this ball. If we collected a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) in the previous operation, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, including when this is the first time to do this operation, the cost of this operation is 1.



Find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls when we optimally choose p and q.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9
* If i \neq j, x_i \neq x_j or y_i \neq y_j.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer. The coordinates x_i and y_i for each ball are integers such that -10^9 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^9.**
def func_1():
    N = read_int()
    balls = []
    for _ in range(N):
        balls.append(read_int_array())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `balls` contains N integer arrays returned by `read_int_array()`, `_` is equal to N, and `N` is the total number of iterations of the loop.
    func_8(func_2(N, balls))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `N` representing the number of balls. It then reads `N` pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each ball. After that, it calls `func_2` with `N` and the list of ball coordinates as parameters and passes the result to `func_8`. The functionality of `func_1` is to calculate the maximum number of balls that share the same coordinates based on the input provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(n, balls):
    bdict = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for (x, y) in balls:
        bdict[x].add(y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the 'balls' list have been added to the 'bdict' dictionary
    tried = set()
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            p, q = balls[j][0] - balls[i][0], balls[j][1] - balls[i][1]
            if (p, q) not in tried:
                tried.add((p, q))
                tried.add((-p, -q))
                points = score(p, q)
                if points < ans:
                    ans = points
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` contains the minimum score calculated by the `score` function for all pairs of differences between elements in the 'balls' list. `tried` contains all unique pairs of differences and their negations that were checked during the loop iterations. `p` and `q` hold the last calculated differences between elements in the 'balls' list, `i` is equal to or greater than `n`
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum score calculated by the 'score' function for all pairs of differences between elements in the 'balls' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts two parameters, n and balls. It constructs a dictionary bdict from the elements in the balls list. Then, it iterates through all pairs of points in the balls list, calculates the score based on their differences, and keeps track of the minimum score found. The function returns this minimum score. The code does not explicitly define the data type for parameter n, leading to potential ambiguity. Additionally, it relies on a score function that is not provided in the code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def score(p, q):
    out = n
    for (x, y) in balls:
        nx, ny = x + p, y + q
        
        if ny in bdict.get(nx, []):
            out -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `out` is equal to the number of times `ny` is not in the list corresponding to `nx` in `bdict` for all elements in `balls`.
    return out
    #The program returns the number of times `ny` is not in the list corresponding to `nx` in `bdict` for all elements in `balls`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `score` accepts two parameters `p` and `q`. It iterates through the elements in `balls`, calculates new coordinates `nx` and `ny` based on `p` and `q`, then checks if `ny` is not in the list corresponding to `nx` in `bdict`. The function returns the count of occurrences where `ny` is not in the list corresponding to `nx` in `bdict` for all elements in `balls`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N, and x_i != x_j or y_i != y_j for i != j.**
def func_3():
    if (False and 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' in os.environ) :
        func_4()
    else :
        func_1()
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *N is a positive integer, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 <= i <= N, and x_i != x_j or y_i != y_j for i != j. If the condition (False and 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' in os.environ) is true, there is no change in the values of N, x_i, and y_i. If 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' is not present in the os.environ dictionary, there is also no change in the values of N, x_i, and y_i.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It either calls `func_4` if the condition (False and 'PYCHARM_HOSTED' in os.environ) is true, or calls `func_1` if the condition is false. The function does not generate N pairs of integers as mentioned in the annotations.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, x_i and y_i are integers representing the coordinates of the i-th ball in the two-dimensional plane.**
def func_4():
    solution = solve
    test_inputs = None
    test_outputs = None
    judge = None
    slow_solution = None
    if (solution is not None) :
        if (test_outputs is not None) :
            func_5(solution, test_inputs, test_outputs)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N is a positive integer, x_i and y_i are integers representing the coordinates of the i-th ball in the two-dimensional plane. If test_outputs is not None, judge is None, slow_solution is None, and solution is not None.
        if (judge is not None) :
            func_6(solution, test_inputs, judge)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N is a positive integer, x_i and y_i are integers representing the coordinates of the i-th ball in the two-dimensional plane. If test_outputs is not None, judge is None, slow_solution is None, and solution is not None, then `judge` is not None.
        if (slow_solution is not None) :
            func_7(solution, test_inputs, slow_solution)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N is a positive integer, x_i and y_i are integers representing the coordinates of the i-th ball in the two-dimensional plane. If test_outputs is not None, judge is None, slow_solution is not None, and solution is not None, then `judge` is not None. slow_solution is not None.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N is a positive integer. `x_i` and `y_i` are integers representing the coordinates of the i-th ball in the two-dimensional plane. If test_outputs is not None, judge is None, slow_solution is not None, and solution is not None, `judge` is not None and `slow_solution` is not None. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It involves conditional checks based on certain variables like `solution`, `test_inputs`, `test_outputs`, `judge`, and `slow_solution`. The function does not return any value. It performs different function calls based on the conditions of these variables as described in the annotations.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(solution, inputs_answers):
    total, wrong = 0, 0
    for (args, test_ans) in inputs_answers:
        ans = solution(*args.copy())
        
        if ans != test_ans:
            func_8('WRONG! ans=%s, test_ans=%s, args=%s' % (ans, test_ans, args))
            wrong += 1
        else:
            func_8('GOOD')
        
        total += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is equal to the total number of iterations of the loop, `wrong` is the number of times `ans` is not equal to `test_ans`, `inputs_answers`, `args`, `test_ans`, `ans` remain the same as described in the initial state.
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else 
    '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `solution` and `inputs_answers`. It iterates through the inputs and corresponding expected outputs in `inputs_answers`, calls `solution` with the inputs, compares the output with the expected value, and prints whether the test passed or failed. The function does not have a specific return value, as it is focused on verifying the correctness of the provided solution for a given problem.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6(solution, inputs_gen, judge):
    total, wrong = 0, 0
    for args in inputs_gen:
        ans = solution(*deepcopy(args))
        
        if not judge(deepcopy(ans), *deepcopy(args)):
            func_8('WRONG! ans=%s, args=%s' % (ans, args))
            wrong += 1
        
        total += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is the total number of values generated by `inputs_gen`, `wrong` is the total number of times the `judge` function returned False, `inputs_gen` has been fully iterated over and no more values are produced, `args` is the last value generated, `ans` is the return value of `solution` with a deep copy of the last `args`
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else 
    '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts three parameters: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `judge`. It iterates over the values generated by `inputs_gen` and applies the `solution` function to each value. Then, it checks the result using the `judge` function, updating the `wrong` count if the result is incorrect. Finally, it prints the total number of tests passed or failed based on the comparison results. The functionality of the function is to evaluate the correctness of the `solution` function using the provided test cases and the `judge` function.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer. Each x_i and y_i are integers in the range [-10^9, 10^9].**
def func_7(solution, inputs_gen, solution_slow):
    total, wrong = 0, 0
    for args in inputs_gen:
        ans = solution(*deepcopy(args))
        
        slow = solution_slow(*deepcopy(args))
        
        if ans != slow:
            func_8('WRONG! ans=%s, slow=%s, args=%s' % (ans, slow, args))
            wrong += 1
        
        total += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total` is the total number of inputs generated, `wrong` is the total number of times `ans` is not equal to `slow`, `ans` is updated based on the return value of the function `solution`, `slow` is updated based on the return value of the function `solution_slow`
    func_8('ALL %d TESTS PASSED' % total if not wrong else 
    '%d out of %d tests are WRONG' % (wrong, total))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts three parameters: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `solution_slow`. It iterates over the inputs generated by `inputs_gen`, compares the output of `solution` and `solution_slow` for each input, and counts the number of incorrect outputs. After processing all inputs, it prints a message indicating the number of tests passed or failed based on the comparison results. There is missing information about the specific functionality or return value of the function.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_8():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep`, `file`, `args` remain unchanged, `at_start` is False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep`, `args`, `at_start` remain unchanged. `file` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, then the file is flushed. Otherwise, no changes occur to the program state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in args, writing them to the file specified in kwargs or to sys.stdout by default. It uses the separator specified in kwargs or a space by default. It then writes the end character specified in kwargs or a newline by default. If the flush key in kwargs is True, it flushes the file. The function does not have return values but performs output operations based on the provided arguments.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
