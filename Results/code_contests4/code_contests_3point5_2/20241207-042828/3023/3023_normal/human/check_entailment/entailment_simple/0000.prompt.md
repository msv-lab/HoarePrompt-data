You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N balls in a two-dimensional plane. The i-th ball is at coordinates (x_i, y_i).

We will collect all of these balls, by choosing two integers p and q such that p \neq 0 or q \neq 0 and then repeating the following operation:

* Choose a ball remaining in the plane and collect it. Let (a, b) be the coordinates of this ball. If we collected a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) in the previous operation, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, including when this is the first time to do this operation, the cost of this operation is 1.



Find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls when we optimally choose p and q.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* |x_i|, |y_i| \leq 10^9
* If i \neq j, x_i \neq x_j or y_i \neq y_j.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N

:
x_N y_N


Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
