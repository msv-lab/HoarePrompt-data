The function `func_6` accepts three parameters: `solution`, `inputs_gen`, and `judge`. It iterates over the values generated by `inputs_gen` and applies the `solution` function to each value. Then, it checks the result using the `judge` function, updating the `wrong` count if the result is incorrect. Finally, it prints the total number of tests passed or failed based on the comparison results. The functionality of the function is to evaluate the correctness of the `solution` function using the provided test cases and the `judge` function.
