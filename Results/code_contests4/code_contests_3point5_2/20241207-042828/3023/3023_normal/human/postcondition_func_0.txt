The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `N` representing the number of balls. It then reads `N` pairs of integers representing the coordinates of each ball. After that, it calls `func_2` with `N` and the list of ball coordinates as parameters and passes the result to `func_8`. The functionality of `func_1` is to calculate the maximum number of balls that share the same coordinates based on the input provided.
