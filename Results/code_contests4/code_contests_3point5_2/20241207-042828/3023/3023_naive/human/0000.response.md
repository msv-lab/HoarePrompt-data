Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by optimally choosing p and q. The program iterates through all possible pairs of balls to calculate the cost of collecting each ball based on the chosen p and q values. It then returns the minimum cost among all the possible pairs. The program considers all potential cases and correctly applies the described logic to find the optimal solution.
