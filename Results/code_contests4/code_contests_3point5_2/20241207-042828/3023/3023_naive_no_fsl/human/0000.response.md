Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by finding the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls by choosing the optimal p and q values. The program iterates through all possible pairs of balls, calculates the cost of collecting all balls with each pair, and returns the minimum cost. The logic of checking if a ball has been collected before at coordinates (a - p, b - q) is correctly implemented. The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description and works as expected for all potential cases.
