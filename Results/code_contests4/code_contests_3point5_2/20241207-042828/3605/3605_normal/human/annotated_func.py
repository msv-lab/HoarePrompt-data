#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1,000,000.**
def func():
    print(input() + 4) / 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to print the result of an invalid operation (dividing a string by an integer) when input is concatenated with 4 and then divided by 5. This function does not return the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `x` as mentioned in the annotations.
