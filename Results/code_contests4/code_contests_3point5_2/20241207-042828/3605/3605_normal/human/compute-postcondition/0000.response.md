Example Answer:
The code tries to print the result of adding 4 to the input and then dividing by 5. However, the input function returns a string, so adding 4 to a string will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the code will not execute successfully. 
Output State: **Error: TypeError - unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'**
