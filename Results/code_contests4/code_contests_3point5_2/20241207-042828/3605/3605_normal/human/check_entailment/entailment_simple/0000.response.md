Correctness: **False**

The given program does not match the problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x, but the program simply takes an input and adds 4 to it, then divides the result by 5 without returning the minimum number of steps.

Furthermore, the program does not even define the variable x or use it in any way to calculate the minimum number of steps. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
