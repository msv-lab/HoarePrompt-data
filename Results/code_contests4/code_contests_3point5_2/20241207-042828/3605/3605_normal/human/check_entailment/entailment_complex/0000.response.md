Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not calculate the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach his friend's house as described in the problem description. Instead, it performs an invalid operation by concatenating the input with 4 and then dividing by 5, which does not relate to the problem at all. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
