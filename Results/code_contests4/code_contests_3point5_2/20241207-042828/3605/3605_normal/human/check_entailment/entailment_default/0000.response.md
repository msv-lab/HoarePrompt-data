Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply takes an integer input, adds 4 to it, and then divides the result by 5. This does not calculate the minimum number of steps required for the elephant to reach its friend's house as described in the problem. The output hints also mention that the function `func` does not accept any parameters and the functionality of the function is to print the result of an invalid operation, which does not align with the problem description. Since the code does not perform the required calculation based on the input, it is incorrect.
