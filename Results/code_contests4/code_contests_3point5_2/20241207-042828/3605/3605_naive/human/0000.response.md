Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x. The program simply takes the input, adds 4 to it, and then divides the result by 5, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

For example, if the input is 12, the program would output 3, but the correct answer is 3 steps (3 + 5 + 4 = 12). Thus, the program does not work as expected and is incorrect.
