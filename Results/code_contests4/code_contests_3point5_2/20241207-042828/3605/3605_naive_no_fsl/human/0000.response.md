Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly calculate the minimum number of steps the elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x. The code tries to add 4 to the input and then divides the result by 5, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. 

For example, if the input is 5, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The elephant needs to make one step of length 5 to reach point x, not add 4 and divide by 5. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
