The function `func` reads an input `N`, then reads a string `ss` and splits it at '()' to create a list of substrings `s`. It iterates through the list, joining the substrings, printing them, and splitting them at '()'. After the loop, it extracts the first substring from `s` and calculates the number of opening and closing parentheses in that substring. Finally, it prints a modified version of the original string `ss` with opening and closing parentheses swapped. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
