You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string S of length N consisting of `(` and `)`. Your task is to insert some number of `(` and `)` into S to obtain a correct bracket sequence.
Here, a correct bracket sequence is defined as follows:

* `()` is a correct bracket sequence.
* If X is a correct bracket sequence, the concatenation of `(`, X and `)` in this order is also a correct bracket sequence.
* If X and Y are correct bracket sequences, the concatenation of X and Y in this order is also a correct bracket sequence.
* Every correct bracket sequence can be derived from the rules above.



Find the shortest correct bracket sequence that can be obtained. If there is more than one such sequence, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Constraints

* The length of S is N.
* 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
* S consists of `(` and `)`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the lexicographically smallest string among the shortest correct bracket sequences that can be obtained by inserting some number of `(` and `)` into S.

Output

(((())))(((())))
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    N = input()
    ss = raw_input()
    s = ss.split('()')
    while len(s) > 1:
        s = ''.join(s)
        
        print(s)
        
        s = s.split('()')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `s` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the original string at '()'
    a = ''
    b = ''
    s = s[0]
    N = len(s)
    for i in range(N):
        if s[i] == '(':
            a += ')'
        
        if s[i] == ')':
            b += '('
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is a string of N closing parentheses ')', `b` is a string of N opening parentheses '(', `N` is a positive integer. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', `a` will accumulate closing parentheses. If the character at index `i` in `s` is ')', `b` will accumulate opening parentheses.
    print(b + ss + a)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input `N`, then reads a string `ss` and splits it at '()' to create a list of substrings `s`. It iterates through the list, joining the substrings, printing them, and splitting them at '()'. After the loop, it extracts the first substring from `s` and calculates the number of opening and closing parentheses in that substring. Finally, it prints a modified version of the original string `ss` with opening and closing parentheses swapped. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
