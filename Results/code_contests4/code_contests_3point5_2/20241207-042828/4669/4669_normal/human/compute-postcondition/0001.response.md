Example Answer:
`ss` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes user input as a string. The value of `N` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the user input, `ss` is the user input as a string.
Output State: **`N` is the user input, `ss` is the user input as a string**
