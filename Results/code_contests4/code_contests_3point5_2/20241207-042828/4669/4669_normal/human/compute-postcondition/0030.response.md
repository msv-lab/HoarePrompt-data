Example Answer:
`b` is appended with '(', so if `b` was '(' initially, it becomes '('. The other variables `s` and `a` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is ')', `b` is '('.
Output State: **`s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is ')', `b` is '('**
