Example Answer:
The string `s` is split at each occurrence of '()' and the resulting substrings are stored in a list. If `s` contains '()' multiple times, the list will contain those split substrings. The original string `s` is now replaced by the list of substrings resulting from the split operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the original string at each occurrence of '()'.
Output State: **`s` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the original string at each occurrence of '()'**
