Example Answer:
The value of `a` is appended with another ')' character. As `a` was originally '))', after the execution of this statement, `a` becomes ')))'. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is ')))', `b` is '(' for the loop to execute one more time `s[i]` must be ')'.
Output State: **`s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is ')))', `b` is '(' for the loop to execute one more time `s[i]` must be ')'**
