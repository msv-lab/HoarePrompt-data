Example Answer: 
The string `s` is split at each occurrence of '()', resulting in a list of substrings. If the original string contains multiple occurrences of '()', each one will create an empty string in the resulting list. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be a list of substrings obtained by splitting the original string at '()'.
Output State: **`s` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the original string at '()'**
