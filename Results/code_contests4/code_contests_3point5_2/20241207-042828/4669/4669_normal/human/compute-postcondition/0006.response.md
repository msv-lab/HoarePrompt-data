Example Answer:
The string `s` is split at each occurrence of '()', resulting in a list of substrings. If `s` is 'hello()world()', after splitting, the list would be ['hello', 'world']. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is split into substrings based on '()'.
Output State: **`s` is split into substrings based on '()'**
