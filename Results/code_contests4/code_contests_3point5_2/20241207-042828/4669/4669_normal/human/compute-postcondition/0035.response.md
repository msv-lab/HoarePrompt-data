Example Answer:
Initially, `b` is '(' and after the code `b` is concatenated with '(' resulting in `b` becoming '('. Since there are no changes to other variables, the Output State is: `s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is '))', `b` is '('.
Output State: **`s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is '))', `b` is '('**
