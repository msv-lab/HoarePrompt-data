According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `s`. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `N` is the user input, `s` is the user input as a string. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` needs to have a length greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is the user input, `ss` is the user input as a string, for the loop to execute the first time `s` has a length greater than 1**
