Example Answer:
The code joins the substrings in list `s` into a single string. Since `s` is a list of substrings resulting from splitting the original string at each occurrence of '()', after joining them, `s` will become a single string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a single string.
Output State: **`s` is a single string**
