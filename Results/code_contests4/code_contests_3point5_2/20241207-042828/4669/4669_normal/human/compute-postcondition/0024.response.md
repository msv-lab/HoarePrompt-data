Postcondition: ***`s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is ')', `b` is an empty string, `N` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', the program remains in the same state. Additionally, if the character at index `i` in `s` is ')', the program remains in the same state.***
