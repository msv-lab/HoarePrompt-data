According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the string `s`. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is split into substrings based on '()'. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `s` after splitting based on '()' must be greater than 1.

State: **`s` is split into substrings based on '()', for the loop to execute again `s` length after splitting must be greater than 1**
