Example Answer:
`s` is reassigned the value of `s` joined together as a string. The variable `ss` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the user input, `ss` is the user input as a string, `s` is now a string formed by joining the characters of the previous `s`.
Output State: **`N` is the user input, `ss` is the user input as a string, `s` is now a string formed by joining the characters of the previous `s`**
