Example Answer:
The value of `a` is concatenated with ')', so after execution, `a` becomes '))'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is '))', `b` is '(', `N` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is '))', `b` is '(', `N` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
