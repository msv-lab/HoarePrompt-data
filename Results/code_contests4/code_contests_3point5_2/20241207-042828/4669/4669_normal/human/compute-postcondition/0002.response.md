Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `ss.split('()')`, where `split` splits the string `ss` at each occurrence of '()'. The values of `N` and `ss` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the user input, `ss` is the user input as a string.
Output State: **`N` is the user input, `ss` is the user input as a string**
