Example Answer:
`s` is joined back together as a single string after splitting based on '()'. The length of `s` after joining will always be greater than 1 as it is being joined back together. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a single string with length greater than 1.
Output State: **`s` is a single string with length greater than 1**
