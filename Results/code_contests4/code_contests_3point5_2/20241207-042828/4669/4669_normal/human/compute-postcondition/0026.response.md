Postcondition: ***`s` is the first substring of the list obtained by splitting the original string at '()', `a` is ')', `b` is '(' appended to its previous value, `N` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', the program remains in the same state. If `s[i]` is equal to ')', `b` is updated to include '(', effectively converting the previously empty `b` to contain '(', while `a` remains unchanged as ')'. The value of `N` remains greater than 0.***
