Correctness: **False**

The code provided is just a placeholder function `func_1` that does not perform any operations as described in the problem. It does not accept any parameters and does not return the sum of elements in an array if the predefined value of `k` is 0, or the product of elements if `k` is 1. Since the function does not follow the problem description for any case, the correctness is False.
