#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, and k is either 0 or 1. Each element in the input arrays is an integer between 1 and 106.**
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns the sum of elements in an array if the predefined value of `k` is 0; otherwise, it returns the product of elements in the array. The input arrays and the operation performed on them are predefined within the function.
