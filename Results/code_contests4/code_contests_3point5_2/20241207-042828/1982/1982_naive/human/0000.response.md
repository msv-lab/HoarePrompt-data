Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the greatest beautiful divisor of the given number n by iterating through possible beautiful numbers and checking if they are divisors of n. The program terminates when the beautiful number exceeds n, ensuring that the greatest beautiful divisor is found. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases as it correctly handles the condition for a number to be considered beautiful.
