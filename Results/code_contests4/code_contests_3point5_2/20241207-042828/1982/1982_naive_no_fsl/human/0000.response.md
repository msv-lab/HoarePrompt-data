Correctness: True

The program correctly finds and outputs the greatest beautiful divisor of the input number n. It iterates through possible beautiful numbers starting from '110' and checks if n is divisible by that beautiful number. If it is divisible, it updates the greatest beautiful divisor found so far. The program terminates when the next beautiful number exceeds n. This logic covers all possible cases as per the problem description, making the program correct.
