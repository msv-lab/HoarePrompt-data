Example Answer:
The value of `i` is adjusted by adding '1' at the beginning and '0' at the end. This operation effectively doubles the value of `i` in binary form. The integer value of `i` must remain less than or equal to `n`, so this adjustment ensures it stays within that range. The value of `p` remains the same as it represents the previous integer value of `i` in binary form. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form**
