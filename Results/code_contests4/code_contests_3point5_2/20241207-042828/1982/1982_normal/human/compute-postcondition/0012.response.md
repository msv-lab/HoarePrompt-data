According to the code, the loop can execute again if the integer value of `i` in binary form is less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is divisible by the integer value of `i` in binary form, then the program retains the initial state. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted so that its integer value is less than or equal to `n`, and `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the state that needs adjustment is the value of `i` in binary form. It should be incremented or adjusted in a way that its integer value is still less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted to ensure its integer value is less than or equal to `n`, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form**
