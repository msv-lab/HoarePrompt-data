Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted so that its integer value is less than or equal to `n`, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form. If `n` is divisible by the integer value of `i` in binary form, then the program retains the initial state.***
