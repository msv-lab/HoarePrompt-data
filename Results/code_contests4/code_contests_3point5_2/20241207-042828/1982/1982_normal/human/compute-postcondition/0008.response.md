According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the comparison between the integer value of `i` in binary form and `n`. If the integer value of `i` in binary form is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted, and `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form. To execute the loop one more time, `i` in binary form needs to be adjusted so that the integer value of `i` in binary form is less than or equal to `n`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted so that its integer value is less than or equal to `n`, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form**
