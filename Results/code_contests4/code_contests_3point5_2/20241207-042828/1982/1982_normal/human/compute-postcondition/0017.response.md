Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `p`. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted so that its integer value is greater than `n`, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted so that its integer value is greater than `n`, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form**
