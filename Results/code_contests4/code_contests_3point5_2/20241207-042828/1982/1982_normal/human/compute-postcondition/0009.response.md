Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the integer value of `i` in binary form. The value of `i` is in binary form and has been adjusted so that its integer value is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the value of `p` is the integer value of `i` in binary form. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form has been adjusted so that its integer value is less than or equal to `n`, `p` is the integer value of the previous `i` in binary form**
