According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between the integer value of `i` in binary representation and `n`. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer, `i` is '110', `p` is 1. Since `i` is in binary format and it is being converted to an integer for comparison, it needs to be adjusted so that the converted value is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `i` in binary form should be such that its integer value is less than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` in binary form needs to be adjusted so that its integer value is less than or equal to `n`, `p` is 1**
