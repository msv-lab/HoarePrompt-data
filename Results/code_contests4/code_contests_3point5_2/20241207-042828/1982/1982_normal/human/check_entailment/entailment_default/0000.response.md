Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is supposed to find the greatest beautiful divisor of a given number `n` by iterating through binary strings and checking for divisibility. However, the code does not handle all cases correctly. 

For example, if we take the input `3`, the code should output `1` as the greatest beautiful divisor. However, the code provided will output `3` instead. This is because the code does not consider the case when the greatest beautiful divisor is less than `n`, leading to incorrect output.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for all cases.
