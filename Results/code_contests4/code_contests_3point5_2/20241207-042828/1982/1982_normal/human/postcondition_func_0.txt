The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and iteratively updates a binary string `i` until its integer value exceeds `n`. During this process, it checks if `n` is divisible by the integer value of `i` in binary form and updates the variable `p` accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of `p`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it operates based on user input within the specified constraints.
