Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly follows the problem description. It takes two integers as input and checks if the first integer is a divisor of the second integer. If it is, it prints the sum of the two integers, otherwise it prints the difference between them. The program handles all cases as specified in the problem description and the constraints. For every input within the given constraints, the program will output the correct result.
