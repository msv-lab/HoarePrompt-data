Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes two positive integers A and B as input and checks if A is a divisor of B. If A is a divisor of B, it prints A + B; otherwise, it prints B - A. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases within the given constraints. The logic implemented in the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the provided problem.
