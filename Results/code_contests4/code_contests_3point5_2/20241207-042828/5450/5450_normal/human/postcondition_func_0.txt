The function `func` reads two integers from the user input and checks if the second integer is divisible by the first integer. If it is divisible, it prints the sum of the two integers; otherwise, it prints the difference between the second and first integer. The function operates based on the constraints of positive integers A and B where 1 <= A <= B <= 20. The function does not explicitly return any value.
