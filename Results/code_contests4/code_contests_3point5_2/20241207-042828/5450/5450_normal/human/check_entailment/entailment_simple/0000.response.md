Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It takes two positive integers A and B as input, checks if A is a divisor of B, and then prints A + B if A is a divisor of B, or prints B - A if A is not a divisor of B. The constraints are also satisfied as the input values are integers and within the specified range.

The program accurately implements the logic required by the problem description for all possible cases.
