Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads two integers from the user input and checks if the second integer is divisible by the first integer.
- If the second integer is divisible by the first integer, it prints the sum of the two integers.
- If the second integer is not divisible by the first integer, it prints the difference between the second and first integer.
- The program operates based on the constraints of positive integers A and B where 1 <= A <= B <= 20.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided.
