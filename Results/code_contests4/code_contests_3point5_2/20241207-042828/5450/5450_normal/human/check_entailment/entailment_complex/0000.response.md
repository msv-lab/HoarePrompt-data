Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two integers from the input, checks if the second integer is divisible by the first integer, and then prints the sum of the two integers if the condition is met, otherwise it prints the difference between the two integers. The program operates within the constraints of positive integers A and B where 1 <= A <= B <= 20. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases as specified in the problem description, making it correct.
