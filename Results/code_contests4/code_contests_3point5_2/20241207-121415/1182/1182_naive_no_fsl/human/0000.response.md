Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It is overly complex and does not follow the rules of the problem description. The program uses numpy arrays and functions which are not necessary for solving the problem. Additionally, the logic of the program is hard to follow and it is not clear how it relates to the problem description.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
```
abc
```
Output:
```
3
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```

The program should output 2 for the input "abc" as it only needs to remove one character to make all characters the same. However, the program incorrectly outputs 3.
