Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The logic in the code is not clear and seems to be unnecessarily complex. Additionally, the use of numpy arrays and functions is not required for this problem.

An example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
```
abca
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Actual Output:
```
4
```

This example demonstrates that the program does not handle the case where the characters in the string are not all the same.
