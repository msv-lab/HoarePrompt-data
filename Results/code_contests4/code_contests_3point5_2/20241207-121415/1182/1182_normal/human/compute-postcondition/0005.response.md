Example Answer:
The value at index `k+1` from list `a` is appended to list `b`. The variables `s` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` contains the value at index `k+1` from list `a`.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` contains the value at index `k+1` from list `a`**
