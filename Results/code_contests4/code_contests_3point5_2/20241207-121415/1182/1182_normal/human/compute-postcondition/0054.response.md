Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` is a numpy array containing all elements from list `a`, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` is a list containing all elements of `alp` with at least one element, `k` is equal to `len(res) - 1`, `res` is a list containing the index where each element in `al` is found in `b` using numpy's `where` function with at least one element, `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` after appending for each iteration of the loop, `zz` is a numpy array containing 0, the first element of `res[k]`, and the length of `a`, `z` is the result of applying numpy's `diff` function on `zz` with a length greater than 0. If the length of `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the minimum value from the list `m`. Otherwise, if the length of `m` is not greater than 0, `ans` is the length of `a`. `ans` is decremented by 1.**
