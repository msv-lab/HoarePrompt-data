Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` is a numpy array containing all elements from list `a`, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` is a list containing all elements of `alp` with at least one element, `k` is equal to `len(alp) - 1`, `res` is a list containing the index where the next element in `al` after `aa` is found in `b`, the next element in `al` after `aa`, and `res` now contains the result of appending the index where `aa` is found in `b` using numpy's `where` function if `aa` is in `b`.***
