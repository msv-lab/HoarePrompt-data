Functionality: **The function reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, converts it into a numpy array `b`, finds the indices of each lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'z' in `b`, calculates the maximum consecutive occurrence of each index, and prints the result. The function does not handle any potential errors like invalid input or empty strings.**
