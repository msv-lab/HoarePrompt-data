Example Answer: 
The value at index `k` from list `a` is appended to list `b`. Since `a` is not empty and `k` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value being appended. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not an empty input, `b` contains the value at index `k` from list `a`.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not an empty input, `b` contains the value at index `k` from list `a`**
