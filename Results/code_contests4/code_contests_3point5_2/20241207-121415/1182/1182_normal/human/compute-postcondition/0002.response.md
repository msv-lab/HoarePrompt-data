According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the input `a`. If the length of `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is not an empty input and `b` is still an empty list. 
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not an empty input, `b` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `a` has a length of at least 1**
