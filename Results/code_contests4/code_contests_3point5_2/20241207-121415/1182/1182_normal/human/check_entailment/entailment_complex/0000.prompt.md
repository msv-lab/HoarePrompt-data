You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke can change a string t of length N into a string t' of length N - 1 under the following rule:

* For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1), the i-th character of t' must be either the i-th or (i + 1)-th character of t.



There is a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Snuke's objective is to apply the above operation to s repeatedly so that all the characters in s are the same. Find the minimum necessary number of operations.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.**
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    b = []
    for k in range(len(a)):
        b.append(a[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` is a list containing all elements from list `a`
    b = np.array(b)
    alp = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    al = []
    for k in range(len(alp)):
        al.append(alp[k])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` is a numpy array containing all elements from list `a`, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` is a list containing all elements of `alp`, `k` is equal to `len(alp) - 1`
    res = []
    for aa in al:
        if aa in b:
            res.append(np.where(b == aa))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` is a numpy array containing all elements from list `a`, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` is a list containing all elements of `alp` with at least one element, `k` is equal to `len(alp) - 1`, `res` is a list containing the index where each element in `al` is found in `b` using numpy's `where` function.
    m = []
    for k in range(len(res)):
        zz = np.hstack([np.array([0]), res[k][0], np.array([len(a)])])
        
        z = np.diff(zz)
        
        if len(z) > 0:
            m.append(np.max(z))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` is a numpy array containing all elements from list `a`, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` is a list containing all elements of `alp` with at least one element, `k` is equal to `len(res) - 1`, `res` is a list containing the index where each element in `al` is found in `b` using numpy's `where` function with at least one element, `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` after appending for each iteration of the loop, `zz` is a numpy array containing 0, the first element of `res[k]`, and the length of `a`, `z` is the result of applying numpy's `diff` function on `zz` with a length greater than 0.
    if (len(m) > 0) :
        ans = np.min(m)
    else :
        ans = len(a)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is not empty, `b` is a numpy array containing all elements from list `a`, `alp` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `al` is a list containing all elements of `alp` with at least one element, `k` is equal to `len(res) - 1`, `res` is a list containing the index where each element in `al` is found in `b` using numpy's `where` function with at least one element, `m` is a list containing the maximum value of `z` after appending for each iteration of the loop, `zz` is a numpy array containing 0, the first element of `res[k]`, and the length of `a`, `z` is the result of applying numpy's `diff` function on `zz` with a length greater than 0. If the length of `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the minimum value from the list `m`. Otherwise, if the length of `m` is not greater than 0, `ans` is the length of `a`.
    ans -= 1
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, converts it into a numpy array `b`, finds the indices of each lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'z' in `b`, calculates the maximum consecutive occurrence of each index, and prints the result. The function does not handle any potential errors like invalid input or empty strings.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
