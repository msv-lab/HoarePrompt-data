Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, converts it into a numpy array `b`, finds the indices of each lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'z' in `b`, calculates the maximum consecutive occurrence of each index, and prints the result. The code accurately follows the problem description by applying the necessary operations to reduce the string to a single character. The code handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each example given. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
