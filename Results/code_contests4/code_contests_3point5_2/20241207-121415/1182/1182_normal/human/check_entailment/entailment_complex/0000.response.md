Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the stated problem. The program seems to be attempting to find the minimum necessary number of operations to make all characters in the string `s` the same by converting it to a numpy array, finding the indices of each lowercase English letter, calculating the maximum consecutive occurrence of each index, and then subtracting 1 from the final result. 

However, this approach does not align with the problem description, which requires making all characters in the string the same by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The program does not follow the rule outlined in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the given problem description.
