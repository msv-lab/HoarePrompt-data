You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a plan view consisting of 12 vertical and 12 horizontal squares showing the terrain. Each square is painted white or black. White represents the sea and black represents the land. When two black squares touch each other vertically or horizontally, they are said to be continuous. In this plan view, the area created by only one black square or a continuous black square is called an "island". For example, in the figure below, there are five islands.

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. One plan view is given for each dataset. A plan view is represented by 12 rows of 12 number columns, with black squares represented by 1 and white squares represented by 0. The datasets are separated by a single blank line.

The number of datasets does not exceed 20.

Output

Outputs the number of islands on one line for each dataset.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(y, x):
    if (0 <= y <= 11 and 0 <= x <= 11) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: y and x are integers. Either y is outside the range of 0 to 11 or x is outside the range of 0 to 11
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `y` and `x`. It returns True if both `y` and `x` are within the range of 0 to 11 inclusive. Otherwise, it returns False. The function checks if `y` and `x` are within the specified range and returns the corresponding boolean value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each dataset consists of a 12x12 grid of 0s and 1s representing the plan view, where 1 represents a black square and 0 represents a white square.**
def func_2(y, x):
    if (g[y][x] == '0') :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 when the value at position (x, y) in the 12x12 grid is '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view. If (g[y][x] != '0'), then the value at position (y,x) in the grid is not equal to '0'.
    g[y][x] = '0'
    for i in xrange(4):
        nexty = y + dy[i]
        
        nextx = x + dx[i]
        
        if not func_1(nexty, nextx):
            continue
        
        if visited[nexty][nextx] == 0 and g[nexty][nextx] == '1':
            visited[nexty][nextx] = 1
            func_2(nexty, nextx)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view. If the loop executes, all positions in the grid that are reachable from the starting position (y, x) and contain '1' are marked as visited.
    return 1
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `y` and `x`, representing coordinates in a 12x12 grid of 0s and 1s. If the value at position (x, y) in the grid is '0', the function returns 0. Otherwise, it marks all reachable positions containing '1' as visited and returns 1.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
