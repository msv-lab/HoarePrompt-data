Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions. The first function (`func_1`) checks if a given position `(y, x)` is within the boundaries of the 12x12 grid. This function correctly returns `True` if the position is within bounds and `False` otherwise.

The second function (`func_2`) recursively explores the grid starting from a given position `(y, x)` and marks all connected black squares as visited. It correctly handles the logic of marking visited squares and recursively exploring the grid. The function returns `1` when it finishes exploring all connected black squares.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description, which is to count the number of islands in a given plan view grid. The program ensures that each island is counted only once and handles the different cases of island configurations.
