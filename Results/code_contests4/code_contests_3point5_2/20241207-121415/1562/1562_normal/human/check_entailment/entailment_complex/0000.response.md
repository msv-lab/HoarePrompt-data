Correctness: **False**

The provided code includes two functions that are aimed at determining the number of islands in a given plan view. However, there are multiple issues with the code that make it incorrect:

1. The code does not handle the case where islands can be diagonal to each other. The problem description states that islands are formed by black squares touching each other vertically or horizontally. The code only checks for adjacent black squares in the vertical and horizontal directions, neglecting the possibility of diagonal adjacency.

2. The code does not correctly identify all the islands in the given plan view. The island counting logic in the code may miss some islands or incorrectly count them due to the limited way it checks for continuity between black squares.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness of the program false.
