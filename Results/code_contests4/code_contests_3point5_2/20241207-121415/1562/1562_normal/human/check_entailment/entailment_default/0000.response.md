Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided reads the input data for multiple datasets, where each dataset represents a plan view of a 12x12 grid consisting of 0s and 1s. It then uses a recursive function `func_2` to traverse the grid and count the number of islands. The function marks visited positions and explores neighboring positions if they contain a '1'.

However, the code has a potential issue with the input processing. The code reads the input row by row, but the inner loop that processes each character of the row seems to be incorrect. Instead of iterating over the characters of the row, it iterates over the row itself. This will result in the incorrect parsing of the input data and will not correctly form the 12x12 grid.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
