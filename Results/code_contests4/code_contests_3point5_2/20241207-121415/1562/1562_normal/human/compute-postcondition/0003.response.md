Example Answer:
The value at position (y, x) in the grid is assigned '0'. The rest of the grid remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view with the value at position (y, x) set to '0'.
Output State: **The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view with the value at position (y, x) set to '0'**
