The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `y` and `x`, representing the coordinates of a 12x12 grid. The grid consists of 0s and 1s, where 1 represents a black square and 0 represents a white square. If the value at position (x, y) in the grid is '0', the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integer parameters `y` and `x`, and return 0 if the value at position (x, y) in the grid is '0', and return 1 otherwise.
