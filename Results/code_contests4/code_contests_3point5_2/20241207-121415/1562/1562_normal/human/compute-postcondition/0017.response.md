Output State: The program continues with the current state where the 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view, `i` is 4, `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`, `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns false, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is executed, and `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`.
