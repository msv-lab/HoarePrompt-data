According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `nexty`, `nextx`, `visited`, `g`, and the return values of `func_1` and `func_2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute again are that `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns false, and `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', and `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is executed. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view. If `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `i` is 0, `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`, `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns false, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is executed, and `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]`.**
