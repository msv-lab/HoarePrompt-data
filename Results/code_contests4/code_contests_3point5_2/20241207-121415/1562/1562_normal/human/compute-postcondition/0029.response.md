Postcondition: ***The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view. If `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 0 and `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `i` is 0, `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`, `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns false, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is executed, and `nexty` is assigned the value of `y + dy[i]` after the execution of the if-else block. After the code snippet executes, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is set to 1.***
