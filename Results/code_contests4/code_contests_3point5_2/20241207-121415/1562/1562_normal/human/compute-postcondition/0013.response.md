Postcondition: ***The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view. Initially, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Variable `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`. If `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns false, then the program state remains the same. After the execution of the if statement, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', and `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is executed.***
