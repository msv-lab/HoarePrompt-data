Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `y` and `x`, representing coordinates in a 12x12 grid of 0s and 1s. If the value at position (x, y) in the grid is '0', the function returns 0. Otherwise, it marks all reachable positions containing '1' as visited and returns 1.** 

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- The annotations mention a function `func_1` being called within the loop, but its functionality is not described, so it is unclear how it impacts the overall behavior of the function.
- The annotations suggest a marking of visited positions, but it's not explicitly specified how this marking affects the return value or the overall purpose of the function.
