According to the code, the loop can execute 4 times with `i` ranging from 0 to 3. The loop depends on `i`, `nextx`, `func_1(nexty, nextx)`, `visited[nexty][nextx]`, `g[nexty][nextx]`, and `func_2(nexty, nextx)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be:
State: **The 12x12 grid consists of 0s and 1s representing the plan view. `i` is 4, `nextx` is assigned the value of `x + dx[i]`, `func_1(nexty, nextx)` returns false, `visited[nexty][nextx]` is 1, `g[nexty][nextx]` is '1', and `func_2(nexty, nextx)` is executed**.
