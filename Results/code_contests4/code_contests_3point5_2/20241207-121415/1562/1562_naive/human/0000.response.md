Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the number of islands in the provided plan view. The issue lies in the function `func_1(y, x)` which returns True if the coordinates are within the grid but does not check if the cell is already visited or if it is a part of the same island. This can lead to incorrect island counting.

For example, consider the input:
```
111100001111
111000001111
110000001111
100000001111
000100010000
000000111000
000001111100
100011111110
110001111100
111000111000
111100010000
000000000000
```

In this case, the program would incorrectly count the number of islands.
