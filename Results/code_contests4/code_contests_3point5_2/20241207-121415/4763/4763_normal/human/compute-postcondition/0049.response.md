Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is equal to `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of `arr`. Additionally, the tuple at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to the tuple at index `i` in `arr` and the tuple at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'***
