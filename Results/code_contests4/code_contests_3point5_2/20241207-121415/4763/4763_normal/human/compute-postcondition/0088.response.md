According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j + k`, `i` is increased by `k`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is still equal to 1, `put` is assigned the first element of `vis`, `arr[j]` is now assigned the value of `put`.

To execute the loop one more time:
1. `i` needs to be increased by `k` again.
2. `j` should be updated to `i + k` for the next iteration.
3. The value of `put` needs to be updated to the next element in `vis`.
4. `arr[j]` should be updated with the new value of `put`.

State: **`arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j + k`, `i` is increased by `2k`, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is still equal to 1, `put` is assigned the next element of `vis`, `arr[j]` is now assigned the value of the updated `put`.**
