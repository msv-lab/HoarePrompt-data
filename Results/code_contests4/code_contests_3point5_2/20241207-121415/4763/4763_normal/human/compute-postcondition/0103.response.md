Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i` for the loop to execute one more time. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the program returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
