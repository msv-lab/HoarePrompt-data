Example Answer:
The element at index `j` in `arr` is added to the set `vis`. The set `vis` now contains an additional element. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the value at index `i` in `arr` is a valid tuple value, `vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr`, `j` is the next valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?' and `vis` has an additional element.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the value at index `i` in `arr` is a valid tuple value, `vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr` with an additional element, `j` is the next valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'**
