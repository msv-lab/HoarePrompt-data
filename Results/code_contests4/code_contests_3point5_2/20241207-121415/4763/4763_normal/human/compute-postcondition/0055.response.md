According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and the contents of `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is set to `i`. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `arr`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is equal to `i`, and if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. The loop will execute one more time as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`**
