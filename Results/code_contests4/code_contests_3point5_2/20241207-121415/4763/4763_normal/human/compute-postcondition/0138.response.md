Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. If the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, the loop will iterate over all elements in `arr` based on the range and step `k`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and not equal to '?', the function returns False. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`. If the length of `vis` is equal to 1, after all iterations of the loop, all elements in `arr` will be replaced with the elements in `vis`. `j` will be the last valid index of `arr` before the loop terminates, `put` will be the last non-'?' element of `arr`, `vis` will still be a set containing all non-'?' elements of `arr`, and the length of `vis` will not be equal to 2.***
