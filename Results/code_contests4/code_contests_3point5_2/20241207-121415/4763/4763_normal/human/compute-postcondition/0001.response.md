Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped with `y` being assigned the value of `x % y`. Since no initial state is provided, the values of `x` and `y` before the swap are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` have been swapped.
Output State: **`x` and `y` have been swapped**
