The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of tuples containing two integers n and k (where 2 <= k <= n <= 3 â‹… 10^5 and k is even) and a string s of length n consisting of only 0, 1, and ?, and `k`, which is an integer. The function has multiple return cases, where in Case 14, the program returns True. In all other cases (Cases 1 to 13), the program returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to analyze the input list of tuples and string based on the given constraints and return True in Case 14 and False in all other cases.
