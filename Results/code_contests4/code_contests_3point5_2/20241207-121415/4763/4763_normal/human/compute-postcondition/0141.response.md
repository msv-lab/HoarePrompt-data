According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than 0**
