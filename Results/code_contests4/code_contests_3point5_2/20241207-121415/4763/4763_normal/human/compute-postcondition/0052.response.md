Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is equal to `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of `arr`. The condition (arr[j] is equal to arr[i] or arr[j] is equal to '?') is met. The element at index `j` in `arr` is equal to '?'***
