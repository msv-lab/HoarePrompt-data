According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, `vis`, and the index boundaries. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `put` is the next non-'?' element of `arr`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements of `arr`, length of `vis` is not equal to 2, `k` is a valid step size, and `arr[j]` is assigned the value of the next non-'?' element of `arr`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `j` needs to be updated based on the step size `k`.
- `put` should be updated to the next non-'?' element of `arr`.
- `vis` needs to be updated to include the latest non-'?' element of `arr`.
- Ensure that the length of `vis` is still not equal to 2 to continue the loop.
- Ensure that the index `j` does not exceed the length of `arr`.

State: **`j` is equal to `i + 2k`, `put` is the next non-'?' element of `arr`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements of `arr`, length of `vis` is still not equal to 2**
