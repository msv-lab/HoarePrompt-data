Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is equal to `i`, and if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. The loop will execute one more time as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the program returns False. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
