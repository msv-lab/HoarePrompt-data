According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `len(arr)`. If `i` is less than `len(arr)`, the loop can execute once more. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. So for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `arr` must be greater than `i`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `arr` must be greater than `i`**
