Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then `arr` remains unchanged after all iterations. If all elements in `arr` are valid tuple values, `vis` contains only `put`, `put` is the first element of `vis`, `len(vis)` is 1, `j` is the last valid index in `arr` based on `k`, all elements at index `j` in `arr` are not equal to '?', `i` is valid, `k` is valid, and the length of `arr` is greater than `i`.***
