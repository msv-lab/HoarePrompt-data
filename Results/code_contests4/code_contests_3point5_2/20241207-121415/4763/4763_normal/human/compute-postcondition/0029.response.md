According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and the contents of the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the value at index `i` in `arr` is a valid tuple value, `vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr` with an additional element if `arr[j] != '?'`, `j` is the next valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'.

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- The value of `j` should be updated to the next valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`.
- The element at the new index `j` in `arr` should not be equal to '?'.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the value at the updated index `j` in `arr` is a valid tuple value, `vis` is a set containing the updated element at index `j` in `arr` with an additional element if `arr[j] != '?'`, `j` is the next valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, and the updated element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'**
