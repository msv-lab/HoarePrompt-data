According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, and `k`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the value at index `i` in `arr` is a valid tuple value, `vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr`, `j` is equal to `i`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'. Since `j` is equal to `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to be the next valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`.
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the value at index `i` in `arr` is a valid tuple value, `vis` is a set containing the element at index `j` in `arr`, `j` is the next valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?'**
