According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `j`, `arr`, and `vis`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `j+k` where `j` is equal to `i+k`, and the `(j+k)`th element of `arr` is not equal to '?'. `vis` is a set containing the `(j+k)`th element of `arr`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- The value of `i` needs to be updated based on the step size `k`.
- The `(j+k)`th element of `arr` should be checked to ensure it's not equal to '?'.
- The `(j+k)`th element of `arr` needs to be added to the set `vis`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `(i+2k)` where `i` is equal to `i+k` and `k` is a valid step size. The `(i+2k)`th element of `arr` is not equal to '?'. `vis` is a set containing the `(i+2k)`th element of `arr` and has added this element to the set**.
