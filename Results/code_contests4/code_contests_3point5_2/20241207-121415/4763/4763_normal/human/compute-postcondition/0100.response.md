Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i` for the loop to execute one more time. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then the element at index `j` has been updated to be equal to the element at index `i`. Otherwise, the elements remain unchanged.***
