Example Answer:
The element at index `j` of `arr` is added to the set `vis`. Since the jth element of `arr` is not equal to '?', it is added to the set `vis`. The values of `arr`, `vis`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, for the loop to execute the first time the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, the ith element of `arr` is equal to '?', the jth element of `arr` is not equal to '?`, `vis` is a set containing the jth element of `arr`, `j` is equal to `i`, `k` is a valid step size**
