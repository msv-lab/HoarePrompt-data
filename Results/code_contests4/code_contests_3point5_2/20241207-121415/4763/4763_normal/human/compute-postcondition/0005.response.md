Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are swapped, where `x` is now the previous value of `y` and `y` is now the result of `x % y`. The loop will execute again if `y` evaluates to True. 
Output State: **`x` is the previous value of `y`, `y` is the result of `x % y`, the loop will execute again if `y` evaluates to True**
