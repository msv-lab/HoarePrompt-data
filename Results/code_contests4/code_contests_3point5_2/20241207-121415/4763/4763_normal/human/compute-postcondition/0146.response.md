Example Answer:
`dic[arr[i]] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `arr[i]` in the dictionary `dic` by 1. The value of `arr[i]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact change in the dictionary. The initial state of the dictionary `dic` is known, which has keys '1', '0', '?' with values 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values 1 (if arr[i] was '1' or '0' or '?'), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values 1 (if arr[i] was '1' or '0' or '?'), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than 1**
