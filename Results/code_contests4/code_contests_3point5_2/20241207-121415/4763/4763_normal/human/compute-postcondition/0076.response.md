Example Answer:
`vis` is updated by adding the element at index `j` in `arr`. The element at index `j` is not equal to '?', so the element is added to the set `vis`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `2k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]` added.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `2k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]` added**
