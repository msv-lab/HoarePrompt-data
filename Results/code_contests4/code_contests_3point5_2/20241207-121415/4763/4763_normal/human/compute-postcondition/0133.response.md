Example Answer:
The value of `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, and based on the initial state, `put` is the next non-'?' element of `arr`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `arr[j]` will be updated with the value of the next non-'?' element of `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`j` is equal to `i + k`, `put` is the next non-'?' element of `arr`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements of `arr`, length of `vis` is not equal to 2, `k` is a valid step size, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of the next non-'?' element of `arr`**
