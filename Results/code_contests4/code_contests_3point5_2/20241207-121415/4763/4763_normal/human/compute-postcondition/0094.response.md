According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i`, `arr`, and `k`. If the length of `arr` is at least 1 and greater than `i`, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `j` is equal to `i`, so the loop can execute one more time if the length of `arr` is greater than `i`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, and `j` is equal to `i` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i` for the loop to execute one more time**
