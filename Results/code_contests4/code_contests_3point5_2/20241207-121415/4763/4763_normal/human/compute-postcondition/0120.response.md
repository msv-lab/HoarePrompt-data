Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `arr` is greater than `j+k` where `j` is equal to `i+k` and `k` is a valid step size. The `(j+k)`th element of `arr` is not equal to '?'. `vis` is a set containing the `(j+k)`th element of `arr` and has added this element to the set.***
