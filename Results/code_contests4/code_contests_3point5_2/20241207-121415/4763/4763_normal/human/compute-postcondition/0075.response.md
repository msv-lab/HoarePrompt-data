According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, `arr`, and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]` added. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by `k` again, and `i` must still be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `2k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]` added**
