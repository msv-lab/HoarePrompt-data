According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` evaluates to True, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` and `y` have been swapped. Since only `y` is mentioned in the loop condition, the value of `x` being swapped with `y` does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`x` and `y` have been swapped, for the loop to execute again `y` needs to evaluate to True**
