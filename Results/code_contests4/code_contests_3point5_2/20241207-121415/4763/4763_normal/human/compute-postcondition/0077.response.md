Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `2k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]` added. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the set `vis` contains the element `arr[j]` added.***
