According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows:
- `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to '?', then `arr` remains unchanged after all iterations.
- If all elements in `arr` are valid tuple values.
- `vis` contains only `put`.
- `put` is the first element of `vis`.
- `len(vis)` is 1.
- `j` is the last valid index in `arr` based on `k`.
- All elements at index `j` in `arr` are not equal to '?'.
- `i` is valid.
- `k` is valid.
- The length of `arr` is greater than `i`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` should be increased by 1.
- Ensure that the new index `i` is less than the length of `arr` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of `arr`**
