Example Answer:
`arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`, where `j` is equal to `i + 2k`. The values of `i` and `k` are unknown, so the exact value of `j` cannot be calculated. The value of `put` is assigned the next element of `vis`, which means `put` is updated. `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, and the length is still equal to 1, so `vis` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j + k`, `i` is increased by `2k`, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is still equal to 1, `put` is assigned the next element of `vis`, `arr[j]` is now assigned the value of the updated `put`.
Output State: **`arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j + k`, `i` is increased by `2k`, `j` is equal to `i + 2k`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is still equal to 1, `put` is assigned the next element of `vis`, `arr[j]` is now assigned the value of the updated `put`**
