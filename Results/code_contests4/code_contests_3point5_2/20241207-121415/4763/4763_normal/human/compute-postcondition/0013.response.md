According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `args`, which is a non-empty iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is non-empty. To execute the loop one more time, `args` must still be non-empty.

State: **n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False, for the loop to execute again args is a non-empty iterable**
