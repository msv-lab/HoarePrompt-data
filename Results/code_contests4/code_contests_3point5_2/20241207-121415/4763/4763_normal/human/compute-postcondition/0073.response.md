Example Answer:
The code adds the element at index `j` from the list `arr` into the set `vis`. The set `vis` now contains an additional element. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]` added.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]` added**
