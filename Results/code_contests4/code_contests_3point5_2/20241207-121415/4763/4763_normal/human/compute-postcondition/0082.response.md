Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`, for the loop to execute `i` should be less than the length of `arr`, all elements in `arr` are not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is not equal to 2. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the length of `vis` is equal to 1***
