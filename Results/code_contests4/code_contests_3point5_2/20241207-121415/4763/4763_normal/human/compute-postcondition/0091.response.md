Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple. If the length of `vis` is 1, then `arr` has the tuple `put` at every index `j` where `j` is a multiple of `k`, `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is still equal to 1, and `put` is assigned the last element of `vis`.***
