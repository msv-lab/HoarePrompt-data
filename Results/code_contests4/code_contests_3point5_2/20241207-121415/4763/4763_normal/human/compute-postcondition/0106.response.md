According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `k`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `j` needs to be updated based on the range and step `k`.
2. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the loop can continue, else it returns False.
3. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', there is no change in the state of the program variables.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, `j` is updated based on the range and step `k`, and the conditions for comparison are met for the loop to execute one more time**
