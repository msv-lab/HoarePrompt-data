According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `arr` has at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`, `i` should be less than the length of `arr`, all elements in `arr` are not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is equal to 1, and `put` is assigned the first element of `vis`.

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `k` until it reaches the length of `arr`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, all elements in `arr` are not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is equal to 1, `put` is assigned the first element of `vis`, for the loop to execute `j` is equal to `i`**
