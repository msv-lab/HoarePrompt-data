Example Answer:
`vis` is a set containing the `(i+2k)`th element of `arr` and has added this element to the set. The value of `j` is not provided, so the specific element added to `vis` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `(i+2k)` where `i` is equal to `i+k` and `k` is a valid step size. The `(i+2k)`th element of `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the `(i+2k)`th element of `arr`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `(i+2k)` where `i` is equal to `i+k` and `k` is a valid step size. The `(i+2k)`th element of `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the `(i+2k)`th element of `arr`**
