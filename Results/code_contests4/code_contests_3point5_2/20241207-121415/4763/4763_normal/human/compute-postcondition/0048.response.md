According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, and `k`. If the list `arr` has at least 1 tuple, and `i` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of `arr`, then the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of `arr`, and `j` is now equal to `i`.
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is equal to `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of `arr`**
