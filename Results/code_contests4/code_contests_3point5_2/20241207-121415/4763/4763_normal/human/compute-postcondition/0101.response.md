According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `k`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then the element at index `j` has been updated to be equal to the element at index `i`.
2. If `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the elements remain unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i` for the loop to execute one more time.**
