According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j`, `vis` contains all unique valid tuple values in `arr`, `j` is the last valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, all elements at index `j` in `arr` are not equal to '?`, `put` is the first element of `vis`, `i` is valid, `k` is valid, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by `k`.
State: **`arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j+k`, `vis` contains all unique valid tuple values in `arr`, `j` is the last valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, all elements at index `j+k` in `arr` are not equal to '?`, `put` is the first element of `vis`, `i` is valid, `k` is valid, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`**
