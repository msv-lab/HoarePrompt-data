According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `vis`, `arr`, and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, `put` is the first element of `vis`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements of `arr`, length of `vis` is equal to 1, `k` is a valid step size, and `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`j` is equal to `i + k`, `put` is the next non-'?' element of `arr`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements of `arr`, length of `vis` is not equal to 2, `k` is a valid step size, `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `put`**
