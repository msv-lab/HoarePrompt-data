Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is equal to `i`. If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`. `i` is increased by 1, `j` is set to `i`, and the loop will execute one more time as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`.***
