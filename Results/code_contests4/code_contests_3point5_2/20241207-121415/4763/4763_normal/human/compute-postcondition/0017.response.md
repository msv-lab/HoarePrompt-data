Example Answer:
`at_start` is already assigned the value False. Since the code snippet does not change the value of `at_start`, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False, for the loop to execute again args is a non-empty iterable.**
