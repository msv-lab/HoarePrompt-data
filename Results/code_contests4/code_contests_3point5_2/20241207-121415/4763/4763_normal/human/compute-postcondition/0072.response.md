According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, and `k`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, and the element at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to '?', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 1 and less than the length of `arr`, the element at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by `k`, `i` should be less than the length of `arr`, and the element at index `j` in `arr` (where j is the new value of `i`) should not be equal to '?'. Additionally, `vis` should be updated to include the new element `arr[j]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by `k`, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `j` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the element `arr[j]`**
