According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, and `k`. If the length of `arr` is at least 1, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, and the element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to '?', the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is increased by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 1. Additionally, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be less than the length of `arr` and the element at index `i` in `arr` should not be equal to '?'. 
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 1, `i` is less than the length of `arr`, element at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is an empty set, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than the length of `arr`**
