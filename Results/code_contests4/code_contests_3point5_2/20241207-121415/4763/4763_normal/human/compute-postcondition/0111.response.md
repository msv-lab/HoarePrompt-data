Output State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`. The loop has iterated over all elements in `arr` based on the range and step `k`. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', the program returns False. Otherwise, if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`.**
