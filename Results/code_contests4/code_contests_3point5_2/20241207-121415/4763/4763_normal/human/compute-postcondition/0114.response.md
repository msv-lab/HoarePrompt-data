According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the list `arr`. If the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, and the ith element of `arr` is equal to '?', the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `vis` set being empty does not impact the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute the first time, the length of `arr` must be greater than `i`, the ith element of `arr` is equal to '?', `j` is equal to `i`, and `k` is a valid step size.
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, for the loop to execute the first time the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, the ith element of `arr` is equal to '?', `vis` is an empty set, `j` is equal to `i`, `k` is a valid step size**
