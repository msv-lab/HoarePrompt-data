Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple and length greater than `i`. `j` is updated based on the range and step `k`. The conditions for comparison are met for the loop to execute one more time. If `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` is not equal to '?', then the program returns False. Otherwise, if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`.***
