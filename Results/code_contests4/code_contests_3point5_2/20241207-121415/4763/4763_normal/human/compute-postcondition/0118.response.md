According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `arr`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`, the ith element of `arr` is equal to '?', the jth element of `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the jth element of `arr`, `j` is equal to `i`, `k` is a valid step size. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by `k` and must be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, for the loop to execute one more time the length of `arr` is greater than `j+k`, the (j+k)th element of `arr` is not equal to '?', `vis` is a set containing the (j+k)th element of `arr`, `j` is equal to `i+k`, `k` is a valid step size**
