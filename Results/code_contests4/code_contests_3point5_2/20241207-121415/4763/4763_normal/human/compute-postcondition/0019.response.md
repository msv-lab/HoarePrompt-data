Example Answer:
The function `file.write` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. Since `end` is not present in `kwargs`, the default value `'\n'` is used. Therefore, a new line character is written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False. A new line character is written to the file.**
