According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `y` evaluates to True. At the end of the last iteration, `x` and `y` have been swapped. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must evaluate to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` and `y` have been swapped, for the loop to execute again `y` needs to evaluate to True**
