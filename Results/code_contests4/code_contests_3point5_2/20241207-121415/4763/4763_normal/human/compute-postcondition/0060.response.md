According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is equal to `i`. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be increased by 2 again.
- `j` needs to be updated to be equal to the new value of `i`.
- If `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` should be updated to be equal to `arr[i]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is increased by 4, `j` is equal to `i`, and if `arr[j]` is equal to '?', then `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `arr[i]`.**
