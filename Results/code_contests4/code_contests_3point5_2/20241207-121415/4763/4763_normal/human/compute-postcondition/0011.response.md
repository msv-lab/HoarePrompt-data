Example Answer:
The value of x is converted to a string using str() and then written to the file using the write method. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False, for the loop to execute again args is a non-empty iterable, x is written to the file using the write method.
