According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values 0, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. The value corresponding to the key `arr[i]` in the dictionary `dic` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `k` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than 1**
