According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. Since `vis` contains all non-'?' elements of `arr`, the loop can execute as long as `vis` has at least one element. Additionally, the loop will iterate over indices starting from `i` up to the length of `arr` with a step size of `k`. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to the last valid index before the loop terminates, which means `j` should be adjusted to `i`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `j` is equal to `i`, `put` is the first element of `vis`.
State: **`j` is equal to `i`, `put` is the first element of `vis`, for the loop to execute `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements of `arr`, length of `vis` is not equal to 2, length of `vis` is equal to 1, `k` is a valid step size**
