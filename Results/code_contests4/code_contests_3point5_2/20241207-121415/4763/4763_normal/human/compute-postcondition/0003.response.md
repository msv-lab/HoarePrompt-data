Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped using tuple unpacking. The new value of `x` is now the previous value of `y`, and the new value of `y` is the remainder of the division of the previous values of `x` and `y`. To execute the loop again, `y` needs to evaluate to True, meaning it should not be equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` have been swapped, and for the loop to execute again, `y` needs to evaluate to True.
Output State: **`x` and `y` have been swapped, and for the loop to execute again, `y` needs to evaluate to True**
