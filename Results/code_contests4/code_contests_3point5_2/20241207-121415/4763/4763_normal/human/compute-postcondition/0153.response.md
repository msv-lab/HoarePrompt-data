Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 <= k <= n <= 3 â‹… 10^5, k is even) and a string s of length n consisting of only 0, 1, and ?, along with an integer `k`. The function iterates over the elements of `arr` and updates them based on certain conditions. It then creates a dictionary `dic` to count occurrences of '1', '0', and '?'. If the counts do not satisfy a specific condition, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The function has multiple return cases, where it returns True in Case 14 and False in all other cases. The annotations mention various cases where False is returned, but the actual code might not cover all the mentioned cases, so the behavior could differ from what is stated in the annotations.**
