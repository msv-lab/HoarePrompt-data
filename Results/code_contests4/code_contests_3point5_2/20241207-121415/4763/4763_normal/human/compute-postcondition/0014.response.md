Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is unknown from the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False, for the loop to execute again args is a non-empty iterable.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False, for the loop to execute again args is a non-empty iterable**
