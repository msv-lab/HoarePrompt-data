According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `k`, and the length of `arr`. If the length of `arr` is greater than `i` and the step `k` is valid, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the main condition to check is that the elements at index `j` in `arr` are not equal to '?'. So for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple where all elements are valid tuple values, `vis` is a set containing all unique valid tuple values in `arr`, `j` is the last valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, all elements at index `j` in `arr` are not equal to '?`, `put` is the first element of `vis`, `i` is valid, `k` is valid, the length of `arr` is greater than `i`**
