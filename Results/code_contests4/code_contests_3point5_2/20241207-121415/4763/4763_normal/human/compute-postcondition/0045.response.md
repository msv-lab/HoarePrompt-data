Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple where all elements are valid tuple values. If len(vis) == 1, all elements in `arr` are equal to `put`, `vis` contains only the value `put`, `j` is the last valid index within the range of `arr` based on the step `k`, all elements at index `j` in `arr` are not equal to '?', `put` is the first element of `vis`, `i` is valid, `k` is valid, and the length of `arr` is greater than `i`.***
