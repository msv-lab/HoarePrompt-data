According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the condition `y` evaluates to True. Right before the loop, the state is not provided. Since the loop will execute one more time, the state right before the loop needs to have `y` evaluate to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **No specific state information is provided, for the loop to execute the first time `y` needs to evaluate to True**
