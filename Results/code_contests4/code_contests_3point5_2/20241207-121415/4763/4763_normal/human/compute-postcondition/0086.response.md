According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`, as well as the length of `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j`, `i` is increased by `k`, `j` is equal to `i`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is still equal to 1, `put` is assigned the first element of `vis`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by `k` and be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **`arr` has the tuple `put` at index `j + k`, `i` is increased by `k`, `j` is equal to `i + k`, `vis` is a set containing all non-'?' elements in `arr`, the length of `vis` is still equal to 1, `put` is assigned the first element of `vis`**
