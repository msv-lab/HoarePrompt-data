The function `func_4` reads input for the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`, and a string `arr` of length `n`. It calls `func_3` with `arr` and `k`, if the result is False, it calls `func_5` with 'NO', otherwise, it calls `func_5` with 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the input constraints.
