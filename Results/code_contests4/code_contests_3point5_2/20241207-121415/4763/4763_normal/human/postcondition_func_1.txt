The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the length of a string `s`, and generates a list `arr` of length `n`. Each element in the list `arr` corresponds to the smallest prime factor of the index. The element at index `i` in `arr` is expected to be equal to `i`. However, the code does not accurately compute the smallest prime factor for all indices due to missing logic in the inner loop. The functionality of the function is to generate a list of length `n` where each element ideally represents the smallest prime factor of the index.
