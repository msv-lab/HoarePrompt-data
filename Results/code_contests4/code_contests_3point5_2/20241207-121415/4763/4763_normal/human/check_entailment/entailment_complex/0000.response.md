Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. In the function `func_3`, there are cases where False is returned based on specific conditions, but the actual code may not cover all of those cases accurately. The annotations mention various scenarios where False is returned, indicating that the code might not handle all possible edge cases correctly. Therefore, it is possible that the program does not work as expected in some instances, making the correctness evaluation false.
