Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functions to determine whether a given string can be transformed into a k-balanced bitstring by replacing '?' characters with either 0 or 1. The program follows the problem description by iterating through the string, making replacements based on the conditions provided, and then checking if the resulting string is k-balanced.

The program handles multiple test cases, reads input correctly, and outputs the result 'YES' or 'NO' as required by the problem description. The functions are structured appropriately to perform the necessary operations and validations.

Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible cases.
