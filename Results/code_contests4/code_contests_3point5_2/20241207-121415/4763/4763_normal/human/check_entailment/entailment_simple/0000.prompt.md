You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called k-balanced if every substring of size k of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters (k/2 of each).

You are given an integer k and a string s which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a k-balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in s with either 0 or 1.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) — the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring.

The next line contains the string s (|s| = n). It is given that s consists of only 0, 1, and ?.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print YES if we can replace every ? in s with 0 or 1 such that the resulting bitstring is k-balanced, or NO if it is not possible.

Example

Output


YES

Note

For the first test case, the string is already a 4-balanced bitstring.

For the second test case, the string can be transformed into 101.

For the fourth test case, the string can be transformed into 0110.

For the fifth test case, the string can be transformed into 1100110.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
