You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called k-balanced if every substring of size k of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters (k/2 of each).

You are given an integer k and a string s which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a k-balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in s with either 0 or 1.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) — the length of the string and the parameter for a balanced bitstring.

The next line contains the string s (|s| = n). It is given that s consists of only 0, 1, and ?.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print YES if we can replace every ? in s with 0 or 1 such that the resulting bitstring is k-balanced, or NO if it is not possible.

Note

For the first test case, the string is already a 4-balanced bitstring.

For the second test case, the string can be transformed into 101.

For the fourth test case, the string can be transformed into 0110.

For the fifth test case, the string can be transformed into 1100110.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.**
def func_1(n):
    return set(reduce(list.__add__, ([i, n // i] for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5
    ) + 1) if n % i == 0)))
    #The program returns a set of all the factors of the positive integer 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer n and returns a set containing all the factors of n. It iterates through all numbers up to the square root of n, checks if they are factors of n, and adds them to the set. However, there is a missing closing parenthesis in the code snippet provided, which would cause a syntax error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string s.**
def func_2(n):
    arr = [1] * n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            for j in range(i, n, i):
                arr[j] = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr` is a list of length `n` where each element is the smallest prime factor of the index, `i` is equal to `n`, each element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `i`.
    return arr
    #The program returns a list `arr` of length `n` where each element is the smallest prime factor of the index, and the element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n`, representing the length of a string `s`, and generates a list `arr` of length `n`. Each element in the list `arr` corresponds to the smallest prime factor of the index. The element at index `i` in `arr` is expected to be equal to `i`. However, the code does not accurately compute the smallest prime factor for all indices due to missing logic in the inner loop. The functionality of the function is to generate a list of length `n` where each element ideally represents the smallest prime factor of the index.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 <= k <= n <= 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string s of length n consisting of only 0, 1, and ?.**
def func_3(arr, k):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != '?':
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                if arr[j] != arr[i] and arr[j] != '?':
                    return False
                if arr[j] == '?':
                    arr[j] = arr[i]
        else:
            vis = set([])
            for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                if arr[j] != '?':
                    vis.add(arr[j])
            if len(vis) == 2:
                return False
            if len(vis) == 1:
                put = list(vis)[0]
                for j in range(i, len(arr), k):
                    arr[j] = put
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If all elements in arr are valid tuple values, the loop will not execute and arr will remain unchanged. If any element in arr is '?', the loop will iterate over the elements and make necessary replacements based on the conditions provided. At the end of all iterations, arr will be updated with valid values according to the given conditions.
    dic = {'1': 0, '0': 0, '?': 0}
    for i in range(k):
        dic[arr[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values representing the count of occurrences of each key in the array `arr`. `i` is equal to `k - 1`. The loop executes `k` times.
    if (dic['1'] != dic['0'] and dic['?'] != abs(dic['1'] - dic['0'])) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`dic` is a dictionary with keys '1', '0', '?' and values representing the count of occurrences of each key in the array `arr`. `i` is equal to `k - 1`. The loop executes `k` times. The condition (dic['1'] != dic['0'] and dic['?'] != abs(dic['1'] - dic['0'])) is false.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 <= k <= n <= 3 ⋅ 10^5, k is even) and a string s of length n consisting of only 0, 1, and ?, along with an integer `k`. The function iterates over the elements of `arr` and updates them based on certain conditions. It then creates a dictionary `dic` to count occurrences of '1', '0', and '?'. If the counts do not satisfy a specific condition, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The function has multiple return cases, where it returns True in Case 14 and False in all other cases. The annotations mention various cases where False is returned, but the actual code might not cover all the mentioned cases, so the behavior could differ from what is stated in the annotations.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. s is a string of length n consisting of only 0, 1, and ? characters.**
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(input())
        
        if not func_3(arr, k):
            func_5('NO')
        else:
            func_5('YES')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of characters. If the function 'func_3' returns False for any iteration, then no variables are affected, and the function 'func_5' is called with the input 'NO'. If 'func_3' returns True for all iterations, the function 'func_5' is called with the argument 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads input for the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`, and a string `arr` of length `n`. It calls `func_3` with `arr` and `k`, if the result is False, it calls `func_5` with 'NO', otherwise, it calls `func_5` with 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the input constraints.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, and s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?.**
def func_5():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 0, 1, and ?, sep is ' ', file is sys.stdout, at_start is False. A new line character is written to the file. The 'flush' key is popped from kwargs and its value is True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` is designed to write elements to a file. It accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, an even integer `k` where 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only characters 0, 1, and ?. The function iterates through the elements in `args`, writing them to the file with a separator specified by `sep`. It then writes a new line character and flushes the file if the 'flush' key is set to True in the keyword arguments. However, the function lacks an explicit return value.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the previous value of `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the previous value of 'y', which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. It then performs a series of operations using a while loop to calculate the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. Finally, it returns the result, which is the previous value of `y` after the loop has been executed.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
