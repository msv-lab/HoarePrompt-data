The function `func_5` is designed to write elements to a file. It accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, an even integer `k` where 2 <= k <= n <= 3*10^5, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only characters 0, 1, and ?. The function iterates through the elements in `args`, writing them to the file with a separator specified by `sep`. It then writes a new line character and flushes the file if the 'flush' key is set to True in the keyword arguments. However, the function lacks an explicit return value.
