Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the total sum of cards that can be drawn to ensure that the total is 20 or less. It correctly checks if the probability of the total being 20 or less is 50% or more based on the opponent's front card and the sum of the first two cards. The logic of excluding the known cards from the remaining deck and calculating the probability is implemented correctly. 
For all possible inputs, the program follows the rules of the game and outputs the correct result.
