The function `func` reads input from stdin, processes the input to determine if the sum of the first two elements in the input list `c` plus any card number from 1 to 10 (excluding elements in `c`) is less than or equal to 20. It then prints 'YES' if the count of valid cards `e` is greater than 3, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have an explicit return value.
