Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the sum of the first two cards, then iterates through all possible remaining cards to determine if drawing one more card would result in a total of 20 or less. If the probability of achieving a total of 20 or less is 50% or greater, it outputs "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO". The program follows the rules and logic described in the problem description for all cases.
