Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input for each dataset, calculates the sum of the first two cards, calculates the number of cards that when drawn will result in a total of 20 or less, and then determines if the probability is 50% or more based on this count. The program outputs 'YES' if the count is greater than 3, otherwise it outputs 'NO'. This logic aligns with the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
