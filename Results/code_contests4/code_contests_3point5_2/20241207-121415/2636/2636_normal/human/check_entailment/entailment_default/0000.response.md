Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The program is supposed to output "YES" if there is a 50% or greater probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw one more card, otherwise it should output "NO". However, the code calculates the probability in a way that might not be accurate. The calculation of `e` does not take into consideration the total number of valid outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is crucial for determining the probability accurately. The code is not handling the probability calculation correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

Therefore, the code needs to be modified to accurately calculate the probability and determine whether to output "YES" or "NO".
