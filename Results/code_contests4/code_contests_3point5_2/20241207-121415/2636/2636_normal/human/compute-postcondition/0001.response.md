Example Answer:
The list `c` is assigned the values converted to integers from the input line after splitting it. The input line is not provided in the initial state, so the values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: There is at least one line in stdin, 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10.
Output State: **There is at least one line in stdin, 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10**
