According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from the standard input. At the end of the last iteration, `cards` contains numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`, `c1c2` is the sum of two numbers not in the list `c`, ranging from 2 to 20, and the code prints 'YES' if `e` is greater than 3, otherwise 'NO'. To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`cards` contains numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`, `c1c2` is the sum of two numbers not in the list `c`, ranging from 2 to 20; code prints 'YES' if `e` is greater than 3 else 'NO'**
