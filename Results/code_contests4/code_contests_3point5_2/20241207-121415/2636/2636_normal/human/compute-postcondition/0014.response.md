The list `cards` is created with elements from 1 to 10 that are not present in the list `c`. The previous values of `c` are unknown, so we cannot determine the specific elements in `cards`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is a list of integers created by converting each element `s` in `line.split()` to an integer; `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding elements in `c`.
Output State: **`c` is a list of integers created by converting each element `s` in `line.split()` to an integer; `cards` is a list of integers from 1 to 10 excluding elements in `c`**
