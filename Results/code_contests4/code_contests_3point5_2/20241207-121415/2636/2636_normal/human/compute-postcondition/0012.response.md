According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from stdin. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input from stdin. 

At the end of the last iteration, `cards` contains numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`, `c` contains the input integers, `c1c2` is the sum of the first two numbers in list `c`, ranging from 2 to 20, and the code prints 'YES' if `e` is greater than 3 else 'NO'. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input from stdin.
