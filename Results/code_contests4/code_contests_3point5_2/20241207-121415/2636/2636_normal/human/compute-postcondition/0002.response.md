Example Answer:
The list comprehension creates a new list `cards` containing numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`. Given that 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10, the values in the list `c` can be any combination of numbers between 1 and 10. The `cards` list will contain all numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`. 
Output State: **`cards` contains numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`**
