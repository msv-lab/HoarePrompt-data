Example Answer:
The list `c` is assigned the input values after converting them to integers. The numbers in `c` will no longer be in the `cards` list. The sum `c1c2` is the sum of two numbers not in the list `c`, ranging from 2 to 20. The code prints 'YES' if the sum `c1c2` is greater than 3, else 'NO'.
Output State: **`cards` contains numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`, `c` contains the input integers, `c1c2` is the sum of two numbers not in the list `c`, ranging from 2 to 20, code prints 'YES' if `e` is greater than 3 else 'NO'**
