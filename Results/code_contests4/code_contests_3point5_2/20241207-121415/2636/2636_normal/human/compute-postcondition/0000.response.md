According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines in the standard input `stdin`. Given that C1, C2, and C3 are integers representing the numbers on the cards, such that 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified to include the condition that there is at least one line in the standard input and the values of C1, C2, and C3 are within the specified range.
State: **There is at least one line in stdin, 1 <= C1, C2, C3 <= 10**
