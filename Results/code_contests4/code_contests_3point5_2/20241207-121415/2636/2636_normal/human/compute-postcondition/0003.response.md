Example Answer:
`c1c2` is assigned the sum of the first two elements of list `c`, which are `c[0]` and `c[1]`. The specific values of `c[0]` and `c[1]` are unknown as they are not provided, but it is mentioned that `cards` contain numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`. Therefore, `c1c2` will be the sum of two numbers not in the list `c`, so it will be a value between 2 and 20. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`cards` contains numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in the list `c`; `c1c2` is the sum of two numbers not in the list `c`, ranging from 2 to 20**
