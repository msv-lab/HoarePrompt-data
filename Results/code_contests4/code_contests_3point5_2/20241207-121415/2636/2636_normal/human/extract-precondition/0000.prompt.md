You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: There is one card each with the numbers from "1" to "10", for a total of 10 cards. This card has numbers on the front and nothing on the back. Using this card, you and your opponent will play the game according to the following rules.

1. You and your opponent are dealt a total of two cards, one face up and one back up. You can see the numbers on the front card of your opponent, but not the numbers on the back card.
2. You win when the total number of cards dealt is 20 or less and greater than the total number of your opponent. For example, if your card is "7" "8" (15 total) and your opponent's card is "9" "10" (19 total), your opponent wins.
3. You and your opponent can draw up to one more card. You don't have to pull it.



Now, as a guide to deciding whether to draw one more card, consider the probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw a card, and if that probability is 50% or more, draw a card. When calculating this probability, you can use the information of your two cards and the card on the opponent's table for a total of three cards. In other words, you don't draw those cards because you only have one for each card.

A program that reads your two cards and your opponent's front card, and outputs YES if there is a 50% or greater probability that the total will be 20 or less when you draw one more card, otherwise it will output NO. Please create.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Given that the number on your first card is C1, the number on your second card is C2, and the number on your opponent's face card is C3, each dataset is given in the following format: ..


C1 C2 C3


Output

Print YES or NO on one line for each dataset.
