You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Cucumber boy is fan of Kyubeat, a famous music game.

Kyubeat has 16 panels for playing arranged in 4 × 4 table. When a panel lights up, he has to press that panel.

Each panel has a timing to press (the preffered time when a player should press it), and Cucumber boy is able to press at most k panels in a time with his one hand. Cucumber boy is trying to press all panels in perfect timing, that is he wants to press each panel exactly in its preffered time. If he cannot press the panels with his two hands in perfect timing, his challenge to press all the panels in perfect timing will fail.

You are given one scene of Kyubeat's panel from the music Cucumber boy is trying. Tell him is he able to press all the panels in perfect timing.

Input

The first line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the number of panels Cucumber boy can press with his one hand.

Next 4 lines contain 4 characters each (digits from 1 to 9, or period) — table of panels. If a digit i was written on the panel, it means the boy has to press that panel in time i. If period was written on the panel, he doesn't have to press that panel.

Output

Output "YES" (without quotes), if he is able to press all the panels in perfect timing. If not, output "NO" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

Output

NO

Note

In the third sample boy cannot press all panels in perfect timing. He can press all the panels in timing in time 1, but he cannot press the panels in time 2 in timing with his two hands.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = input()
    c = [0] * 10
    for i in range(4):
        for j in list(raw_input()):
            if j != '.':
                c[int(j)] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string with characters representing integers, `c` is a list of 10 integers with each index representing the frequency of the corresponding integer in the string `n` (ignoring '.'), `j` is the last character in the input string and not '.', `i` is 3
    print['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= n * 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input string `n`, initializes a list `c` with 10 zeros, and then iterates through the characters of the input string to count the frequency of each integer (ignoring '.'). It then checks if the maximum frequency of any integer in `c` is less than or equal to `n * 2` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. However, the code has issues as it uses `input()` which takes a string and compares it to an integer, and `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. Additionally, the indexing in the print statement is incorrect and should be corrected.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
