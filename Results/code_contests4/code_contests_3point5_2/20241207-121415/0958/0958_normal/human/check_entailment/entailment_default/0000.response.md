Correctness: **False**

The code does not exactly follow the problem description for every potential case. 
1. The code uses `input()` which takes a string and compares it to an integer, this should be corrected to `int(input())`.
2. The code uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python, it should be `input()` instead.
3. The indexing in the print statement is incorrect and should be corrected to `print(['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= int(n) * 2])`.

Therefore, based on the discrepancies mentioned above, the code is incorrect.
