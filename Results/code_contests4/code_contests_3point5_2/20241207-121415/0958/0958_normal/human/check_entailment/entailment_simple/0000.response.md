Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the issues:
1. The program uses `input()` which reads the input as a string, but it should be converted to an integer using `int()` to match the problem description.
2. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. The correct function to use is `input()` which reads a line from input and returns it as a string.
3. The comparison `max(c) <= n * 2` is incorrect. It should be comparing `max(c)` with `n` (converted to an integer) multiplied by 2, as per the problem description.
4. The program attempts to access the element of a list using square brackets for printing the output, which is incorrect. It should use parentheses for indexing.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.
