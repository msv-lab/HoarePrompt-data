#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = input()
    c = [0] * 10
    for i in range(4):
        for j in list(raw_input()):
            if j != '.':
                c[int(j)] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string with characters representing integers, `c` is a list of 10 integers with each index representing the frequency of the corresponding integer in the string `n` (ignoring '.'), `j` is the last character in the input string and not '.', `i` is 3
    print['NO', 'YES'][max(c) <= n * 2]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input string `n`, initializes a list `c` with 10 zeros, and then iterates through the characters of the input string to count the frequency of each integer (ignoring '.'). It then checks if the maximum frequency of any integer in `c` is less than or equal to `n * 2` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. However, the code has issues as it uses `input()` which takes a string and compares it to an integer, and `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. Additionally, the indexing in the print statement is incorrect and should be corrected.
