According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 4. In this case, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5.
State: **`n` is a non-empty string with characters representing integers, `c` is a list of 10 integers with each index representing the frequency of the corresponding integer in the string `n` (ignoring '.'), `j` is '.', `i` is 5**
