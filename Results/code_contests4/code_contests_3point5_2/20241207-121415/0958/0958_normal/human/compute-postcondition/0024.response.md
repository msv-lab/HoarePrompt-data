Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `c` is a list of 10 integers with an incremented value at the index represented by the next character after `j` if it's not '.', `j` is the next character in the input list (not '.'), `i` is 6 for the loop to execute again. If `j` is not '.', then the value at the index represented by the next character after `j` in `c` is incremented. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
