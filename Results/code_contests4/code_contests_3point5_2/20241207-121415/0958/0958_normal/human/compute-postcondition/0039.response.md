The code snippet compares the maximum value in list `c` to `n * 2` and prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the result. The value of `n` is the length of a non-empty string, the value of `c` is a list of 10 integers representing the frequency of each integer in the string `n` (ignoring '.'), the value of `j` is the last character in the input string (excluding '.') and the value of `i` is 3. 

Since the values of `n`, `c`, `j`, and `i` are not directly used in the comparison, their specific values are not relevant for the output state.

Output State: **The output will be either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the comparison result of `max(c) <= n * 2`**
