Example Answer:
The code snippet `c[int(j)] += 1` increments the value at the index specified by `j` in list `c` by 1. The value of `j` needs to be an integer to access the correct index in list `c`. The first element of list `c` is incremented again, so it contains 11 elements now. As long as `j` is not '.', the loop will execute. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string, `c` is a list of 11 integers with the first element incremented again, `j` is not '.'.
Output State: **`n` is a string, `c` is a list of 11 integers with the first element incremented again, `j` is not '.'**
