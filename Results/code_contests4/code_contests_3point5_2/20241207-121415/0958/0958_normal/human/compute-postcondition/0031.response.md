According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-empty string, `c` is a list of 10 integers with each index representing the frequency of the corresponding integer in the string `n` (ignoring '.'), `j` is the last character processed in the input string, and `i` has been iterated through all characters in the input string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character left in the input string.
State: **`n` is a non-empty string with characters representing integers, `c` is a list of 10 integers with each index representing the frequency of the corresponding integer in the string `n` (ignoring '.'), `j` is the next character in the input string, `i` is 0**
