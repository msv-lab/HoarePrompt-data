Example Answer:
The value of `j` represents the index in list `c` where the value will be incremented by 1. The value at index `int(j)` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again with `i` being 6. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `c` is a list of 10 integers with an incremented value at the index represented by the next character after `j` if it's not '.', `j` is the next character in the input list (not '.'), `i` is 6 for the loop to execute again.**
