Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string with characters representing integers, `c` is a list of 10 integers with updated frequencies, `j` is the next character in the input string, `i` is 1 if there are more characters in the input string. If `j` is not equal to '.', then the state of the program variables remains the same as the precondition.***
