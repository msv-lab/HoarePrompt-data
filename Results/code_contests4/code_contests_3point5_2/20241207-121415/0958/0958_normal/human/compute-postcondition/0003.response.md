According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input list generated from `raw_input()`. If the input list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being a string entered by the user does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the input list has at least 1 element. Since `c` is a list of 10 zeros, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the input list must have at least 1 element.
State: **`n` is a string entered by the user, `c` is a list of 10 zeros, for the loop to execute the first time the input list has at least 1 element**
