According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input list. Therefore, the loop will execute if the input list is not empty. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- `n` needs to be a non-empty string
- `c` should remain as a list of 10 integers
- `j` needs to be a character from the input list (not '.')
- `i` is already set to 4

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `c` is a list of 10 integers, `j` is a character from the input list (not '.'), `i` is 4 for the loop to execute**
