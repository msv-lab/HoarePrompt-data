According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is not '.', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string, `c` is a list of 10 integers with the first element incremented again. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next `j` value should not be '.'.
State: **`n` is a string, `c` is a list of 10 integers with the first element incremented again, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should not be '.'**
