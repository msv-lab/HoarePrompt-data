Example Answer:
The value of `j` is used as an index to access the `c` list and increment the value at that index by 1. The value of `j` should be converted to an integer before using it as an index. The initial state is `n` is a string entered by the user, `c` is a list of 10 zeros, for the loop to execute the first time the input list has at least 1 element, and the value of `j` is not '.'. After execution, the value at the index `int(j)` in list `c` will be increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a string entered by the user, `c` is a list of 10 integers with one element incremented, the value of `j` is not '.'**
