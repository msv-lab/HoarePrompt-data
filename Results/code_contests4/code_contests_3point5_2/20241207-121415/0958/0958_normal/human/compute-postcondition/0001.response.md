Example Answer:
`c` is created as a list of 10 zeros. The value of `n` is a string entered by the user, which does not affect the creation of `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string entered by the user, `c` is a list of 10 zeros.
Output State: **`n` is a string entered by the user, `c` is a list of 10 zeros**
