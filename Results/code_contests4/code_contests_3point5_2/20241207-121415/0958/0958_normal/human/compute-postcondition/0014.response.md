According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified in the for loop. Since the loop is currently on the 4th iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 4.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string, `c` is a list of 10 integers, and `j` is not '.'. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be updated to 4.
State: **`n` is a string, `c` is a list of 10 integers, `j` is not '.', `i` is 4**
