The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a variable `c`. In Case_1, it returns the number 10000000000. In Case_2, it calculates the maximum difference between elements in `temp` if 0 and n - 1 are present in `c`. If these conditions are not met, it returns -1. The function does not handle cases where the length of `temp` is less than `i` for any index i from 0 to len(temp)-1.
