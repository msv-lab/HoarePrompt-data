Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between elements in `temp` only if the first and last elements are present in the combination `c`. However, the problem description states that the first and last holds must stay at their positions, which means the maximum difference should be calculated for any adjacent elements in `temp`, not just the first and last ones. The code is not handling this requirement correctly, making it incorrect.
