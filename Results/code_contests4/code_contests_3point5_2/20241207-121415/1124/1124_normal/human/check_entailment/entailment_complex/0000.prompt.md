You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mike is trying rock climbing but he is awful at it. 

There are n holds on the wall, i-th hold is at height ai off the ground. Besides, let the sequence ai increase, that is, ai < ai + 1 for all i from 1 to n - 1; we will call such sequence a track. Mike thinks that the track a1, ..., an has difficulty <image>. In other words, difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.

Today Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights a1, ..., an. To make the problem harder, Mike decided to remove one hold, that is, remove one element of the sequence (for example, if we take the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and remove the third element from it, we obtain the sequence (1, 2, 4, 5)). However, as Mike is awful at climbing, he wants the final difficulty (i.e. the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold) to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold. The first and last holds must stay at their positions.

Help Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of holds.

The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1000), where ai is the height where the hold number i hangs. The sequence ai is increasing (i.e. each element except for the first one is strictly larger than the previous one).

Output

Print a single number — the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold.

Examples

Input

3
1 4 6


Output

5


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5


Output

2


Input

5
1 2 3 7 8


Output

4

Note

In the first sample you can remove only the second hold, then the sequence looks like (1, 6), the maximum difference of the neighboring elements equals 5.

In the second test after removing every hold the difficulty equals 2.

In the third test you can obtain sequences (1, 3, 7, 8), (1, 2, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8), for which the difficulty is 4, 5 and 5, respectively. Thus, after removing the second element we obtain the optimal answer — 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(lst, c):
    temp = []
    for i in c:
        temp.append(lst[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`
    awk = -1
    if (0 in c and n - 1 in c) :
        for i in range(len(temp)):
            awk = max(awk, temp[i] - temp[i - 1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i` for all `i` from 0 to len(temp)-1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, and the length of `temp` must be greater than `i` for all `i` from 0 to len(temp)-1. If 0 and n - 1 are in c, then the described updates are made to `temp` and `awk`.
    if (awk == -1) :
        return 10000000000
        #The program returns the number 10000000000
    else :
        return awk
        #The program returns the updated maximum difference between elements in 'temp', ensuring that the length of 'temp' is greater than 'i' for all 'i' from 0 to len(temp)-1. If 0 and n - 1 are in 'c', then the described updates are made to 'temp' and 'awk', and 'awk' is not equal to -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a variable `c`. In Case_1, it returns the number 10000000000. In Case_2, it calculates the maximum difference between elements in `temp` if 0 and n - 1 are present in `c`. If these conditions are not met, it returns -1. The function does not handle cases where the length of `temp` is less than `i` for any index i from 0 to len(temp)-1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
