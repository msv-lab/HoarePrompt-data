Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a list `c` as input. It creates a new list `temp` that contains elements of `lst` indexed by elements in `c`. Then, it calculates the maximum difference between adjacent elements in `temp` and returns this value as the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold. 

The program correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that the first and last holds are not removed, and it calculates the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold. The logic in the program is consistent with the requirements specified in the problem description.
