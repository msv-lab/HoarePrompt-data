        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i` for all `i` from 0 to len(temp)-1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, and the length of `temp` must be greater than `i` for all `i` from 0 to len(temp)-1. If 0 and n - 1 are in c, then the described updates are made to `temp` and `awk`.
    if (awk == -1) :
        return 10000000000
        #The program returns the number 10000000000
    else :
        return awk
        #The program returns the updated maximum difference between elements in 'temp', ensuring that the length of 'temp' is greater than 'i' for all 'i' from 0 to len(temp)-1. If 0 and n - 1 are in 'c', then the described updates are made to 'temp' and 'awk', and 'awk' is not equal to -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a variable `c`. In Case_1, it returns the number 10000000000. In Case_2, it calculates the maximum difference between elements in `temp` if 0 and n - 1 are present in `c`. If these conditions are not met, it returns -1. The function does not handle cases where the length of `temp` is less than `i` for any index i from 0 to len(temp)-1.
