According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp` and `i`. If the length of `temp` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains all elements of `lst` indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, and the length of `temp` must be greater than `i`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i+1`.
State: **`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i+1`**
