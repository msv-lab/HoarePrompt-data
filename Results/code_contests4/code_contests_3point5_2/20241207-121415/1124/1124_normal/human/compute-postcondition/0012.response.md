According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `temp` list. If the length of `temp` is greater than the current index in the loop `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `temp` must be greater than the current index `i`.
State: **`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i`**
