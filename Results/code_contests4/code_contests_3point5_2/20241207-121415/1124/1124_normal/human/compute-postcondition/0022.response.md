The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `lst` and `c`. The parameter `lst` is a list, and `c` is a variable that is not specified in terms of constraints. 

In Case_1, the program returns the number 10000000000.

In Case_2, the program returns the updated maximum difference between elements in 'temp', ensuring that the length of 'temp' is greater than 'i' for all 'i' from 0 to len(temp)-1. If 0 and n - 1 are in 'c', then the described updates are made to 'temp' and 'awk', and 'awk' is not equal to -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a variable `c`. In Case_1, it returns a specific number. In Case_2, it performs certain updates and calculations based on the elements in 'temp' and 'c' to return the updated maximum difference between elements.
