Postcondition: ***`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, and the length of `temp` must be greater than `i` for all `i` from 0 to len(temp)-1. If 0 and n - 1 are in c, then the described updates are made to `temp` and `awk`. Additionally, `awk` is equal to -1.***
