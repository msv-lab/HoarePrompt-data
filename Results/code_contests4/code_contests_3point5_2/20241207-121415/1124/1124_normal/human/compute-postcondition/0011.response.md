Example Answer:
`awk` is updated to the maximum value between the current `awk` and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `temp`. Since `i` is 0 for the first loop execution, the `awk` value is updated to either `temp[0] - temp[-1]` or `temp[0] - temp[len(temp) - 1]` depending on the index wrapping behavior of the programming language. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`.
Output State: **`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`**
