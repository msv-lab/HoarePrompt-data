Example Answer:
`temp` is appended with the value of `lst[i]`, where `temp` initially contained the elements `lst[i+1]` and `lst[i]`. After execution, `temp` will contain `lst[i+1]`, `lst[i]`, and the newly appended value. The variable `c` is not directly affected, but for the loop to execute again, it must have more elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains `lst[i+1]`, `lst[i]`, and the newly appended value; `c` must have more elements for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`temp` contains `lst[i+1]`, `lst[i]`, and the newly appended value; `c` must have more elements for the loop to execute again**
