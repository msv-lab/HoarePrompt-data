According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `temp` is greater than 0. Additionally, the loop index `i` will iterate over the elements of `temp`. The loop will execute successfully if `temp` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `temp` should not be empty and `i` should be 0.
State: **`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is -1, 0 and n - 1 are present in `c`, `temp` is not empty, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
