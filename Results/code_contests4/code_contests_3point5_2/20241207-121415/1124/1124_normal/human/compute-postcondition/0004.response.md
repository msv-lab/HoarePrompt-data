Example Answer:
`temp` is appended with the element `lst[i]`, and `lst[i+1]` was initially stored in `temp`. The loop can execute again only if `c` has more elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains the elements `lst[i+1]` and `lst[i]`, for the loop to execute again `c` must have more elements.
Output State: **`temp` contains the elements `lst[i+1]` and `lst[i]`, for the loop to execute again `c` must have more elements**
