According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If there are more elements in `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` contains the element `lst[i]`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `c` must have more elements, and `i` should be updated to the next element in `c`.
State: **`temp` contains the element `lst[i+1]`, for the loop to execute again `c` must have more elements**
