Example Answer:
`temp` is appended with the element `lst[i]` where `lst` is a list and `i` is an index. Since `temp` is initially an empty list and the value of `lst[i]` is not specified, the output state after execution is: `temp` contains the element `lst[i]`.
Output State: **`temp` contains the element `lst[i]`**
