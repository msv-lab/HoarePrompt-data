Example Answer:
The maximum difference between elements in `temp` at index `i` and `i - 1` is calculated and assigned to `awk`. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, and the length of `temp` must be greater than `i`.
Output State: **`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i`**
