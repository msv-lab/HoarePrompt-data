Example Answer:
The value of `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp` at indices `i` and `i - 1`. The length of `temp` must be greater than `i+1`, and the updated value of `awk` is the maximum difference. 
Output State: **`temp` contains all elements of `lst` that are indexed by the elements in `c`, `awk` is updated to the maximum difference between elements in `temp`, the length of `temp` must be greater than `i+1`**
