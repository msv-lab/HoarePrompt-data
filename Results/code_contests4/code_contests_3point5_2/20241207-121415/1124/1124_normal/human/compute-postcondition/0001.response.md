According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If c is an iterable object, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` being an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `c` is an iterable object. 
State: **`temp` is an empty list, for the loop to execute `c` is an iterable object**
