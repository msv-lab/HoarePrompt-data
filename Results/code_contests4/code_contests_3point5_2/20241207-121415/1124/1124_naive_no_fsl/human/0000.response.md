Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum difficulty of the track after removing a single hold. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in height.

The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum difference in height between adjacent holds after removing a hold, but the implementation is incorrect. The logic inside the function is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly.

Additionally, the program is missing the necessary import statement for the `itertools` module, which is used in the code but not imported.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
