Correctness: **False**

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is:
```
4
1 3 5 6
```
The expected output should be 2, as removing the hold at height 3 results in the sequence (1, 5, 6) with a difficulty of 2. However, the program may output a different value due to incorrect logic in handling the combinations of holds to remove.
