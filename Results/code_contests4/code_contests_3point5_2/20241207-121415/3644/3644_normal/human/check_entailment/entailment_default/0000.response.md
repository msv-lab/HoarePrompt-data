Correctness: **False**

The code provided in the program section does not actually process the photographs as described in the problem description. The code just outputs a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings without any actual image processing. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

The output hints also mention that the function lacks clarity in terms of purpose or outcome, which further confirms that the code does not actually perform the required task of processing the images. Hence, the correctness of the code is false.
