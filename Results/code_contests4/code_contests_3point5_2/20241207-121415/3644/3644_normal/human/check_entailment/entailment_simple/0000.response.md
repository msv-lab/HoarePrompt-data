Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func` which contains precomputed answers for a series of questions. These answers are in the format specified in the problem description: "YES" if the photograph has been rearranged and "NO" otherwise. The function does not take any input and simply prints these precomputed answers.

Since the program does exactly what the problem description asks for - printing the correct answer for each question based on whether the top and bottom halves of the photograph have been swapped - it is correct.
