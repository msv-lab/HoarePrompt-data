Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always produce the correct output. One case where the program fails is for the following input:

Input:
```
5
1 2
2 1
5 10
10 9
19 1
```

Expected Output: `3`
Your code's Output: `4`

In this case, the program incorrectly counts 4 trees that can be cut down, while the correct answer is 3. This demonstrates that the program does not work as expected for all potential cases, leading to a correctness of **False**.
