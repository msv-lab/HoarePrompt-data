Correctness: False

Explanation: 
The provided code does not handle the case where the last tree in the list can be cut down. In the loop where the trees are being processed, the condition `for i in range(1, len(p) - 1):` should be changed to `for i in range(1, len(p) - 1):` to include the last tree as well. This will ensure that the last tree is considered for cutting down if it meets the conditions. 

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 2
2 1
5 10
10 9
20 1
```
The correct output should be `4` as we can cut down the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th trees. However, the provided code will output `3` as it does not consider the last tree for cutting down.
