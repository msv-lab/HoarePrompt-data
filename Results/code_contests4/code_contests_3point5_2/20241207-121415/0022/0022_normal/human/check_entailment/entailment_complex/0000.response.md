Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input about trees represented by pairs of integers (xi, hi) and processes them according to the conditions specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum number of trees that can be cut down based on the given rules. The program ensures that the fallen tree does not occupy any already occupied point and makes the decision to cut down a tree based on whether the segment to be occupied by the fallen tree is free. The final count of trees that can be cut down is printed at the end.

The program iterates through the trees and correctly checks the conditions for each tree to determine if it can be cut down. It keeps track of the current position of the woodcutters and updates it accordingly based on the tree's position and height. The logic in the program aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description, making it a correct solution.
