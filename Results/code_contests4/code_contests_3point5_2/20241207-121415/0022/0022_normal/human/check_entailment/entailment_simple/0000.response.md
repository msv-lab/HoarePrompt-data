Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input, processes it according to the rules described in the problem description and prints the maximum number of trees that can be cut down. It iterates through the trees and checks if a tree can be cut down to the left or right based on the conditions provided. It keeps track of the number of trees that can be cut down and updates the position of the last cut tree accordingly. 

The program always follows the problem description as it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for determining the maximum number of trees that can be cut down.
