Correctness: **False**

Based on the problem description, the program should read the input about trees represented by pairs of integers (xi, hi) and process them based on certain conditions related to their coordinates and heights. It should calculate the total number of trees that can be cut down by following the rules provided.

After reviewing the code, it seems that the program is not correctly following the problem description for every potential case. One such case is when the coordinates and heights of the trees are such that the optimal strategy is not followed.

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 2
2 1
5 10
10 9
20 1
```
The program should output `4` as the maximum number of trees that can be cut down. However, the current implementation of the code may not handle this case correctly and may give an incorrect output.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
