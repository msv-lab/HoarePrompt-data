According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a valid integer, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`, `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`, `i` is increased by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is a valid integer, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`, `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`, `i` is increased by 2 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
