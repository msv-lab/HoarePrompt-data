Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing at least 3 values obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `p`, if `n` is equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 1, otherwise if `n` is not equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, the length of `p` is at least 3, and the condition (p[i] - h[i] <= pivout) is satisfied***
