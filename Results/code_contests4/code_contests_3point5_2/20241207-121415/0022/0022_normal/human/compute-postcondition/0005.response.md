Example Answer: 
The value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`. The previous values of `p` and `e` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a valid integer for the loop to execute, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, and the value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`.
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer for the loop to execute, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`**
