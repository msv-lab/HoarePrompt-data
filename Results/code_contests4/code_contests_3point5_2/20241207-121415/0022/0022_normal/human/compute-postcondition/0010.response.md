Example Answer:
`h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute another time, and the value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`, `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`, `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`, `i` is increased by 1**
