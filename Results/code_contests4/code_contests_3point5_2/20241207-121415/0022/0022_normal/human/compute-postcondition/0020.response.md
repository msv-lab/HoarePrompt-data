Example Answer:
The variable `cont` is assigned the value 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing the values at index 0 of the lists obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `p`, and `cont` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing the values at index 0 of the lists obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `p`, `cont` is 2**
