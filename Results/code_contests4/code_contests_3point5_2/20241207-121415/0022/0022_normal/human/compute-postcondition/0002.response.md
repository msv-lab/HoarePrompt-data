Example Answer:
`h` is assigned an empty list, so after execution, `h` is an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string, `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a string, `p` is an empty list, `h` is an empty list**
