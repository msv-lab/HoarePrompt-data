Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing at least 3 values obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is assigned the value at index 2 of list `p`, `cont` is either 1 or 2 based on the condition described, `i` is 2, the loop conditions are satisfied for the next iteration. If `p[i] - h[i] > pivout`, `cont` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, `pivout` is updated to the sum of the value at index 2 of list `p` and the value at index 2 of list `h`. Otherwise, `pivout` retains its original value at index `i` of list `p`.***
