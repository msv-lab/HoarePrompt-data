Example Answer:
`e` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element in the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since `n` is a valid integer, the input is successfully split and converted to integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer for the loop to execute, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer for the loop to execute, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input**
