The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing information about trees represented by pairs of integers (xi, hi) where xi represents the x-coordinate of the tree and hi represents the height of the tree. The function is expected to work with the given constraints about the trees' coordinates and heights. The function will likely perform some operations related to the trees but does not return any specific value.
