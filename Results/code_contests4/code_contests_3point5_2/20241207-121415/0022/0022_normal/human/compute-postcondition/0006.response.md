Example Answer:
`h` is appended with the value at index 1 of list `e`. The values of `n` and `e` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer for the loop to execute, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`; `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`.
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer for the loop to execute, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`; `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`**
