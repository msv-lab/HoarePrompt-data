Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing at least 3 values obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `p`, `cont` is either 1 or 2 based on the condition described, `i` is 1, the loop conditions are satisfied. If `p[i] - h[i]` is greater than `pivout`, then after entering the if condition, `cont` is increased by 1. If `p[i] - h[i]` is less than or equal to `pivout`, then after executing the else part, if `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, then `pivout` is updated to `p[i] + h[i]`. Otherwise, if `p[i] + h[i] >= p[i + 1]`, then `pivout` remains unchanged.***
