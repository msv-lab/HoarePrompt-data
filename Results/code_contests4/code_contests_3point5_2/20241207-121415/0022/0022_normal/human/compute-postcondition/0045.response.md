Example Answer: 
`cont` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cont` is unknown, so after execution, `cont` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing at least 3 values obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is updated based on the conditions, `cont` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is 3, the loop conditions are satisfied for the next iteration, `cont` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing at least 3 values obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is updated based on the conditions, `cont` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is 3, the loop conditions are satisfied for the next iteration, `cont` is incremented by 1**
