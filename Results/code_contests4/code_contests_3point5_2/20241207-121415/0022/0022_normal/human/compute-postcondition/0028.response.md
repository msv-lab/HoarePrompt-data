Output State: **`n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing at least 3 values obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input, `pivout` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `p`, if `n` is equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 1, otherwise if `n` is not equal to 1, `cont` is assigned the value 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, the length of `p` is at least 3, and the condition (p[i] - h[i] <= pivout) is satisfied. Additionally, after entering the if condition (p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]), the program variables maintain their initial state and the condition in the if statement is satisfied, `cont` is incremented by 1.**
