Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of list `e` is appended to the list `h`. The value of `e` is obtained from input, so the specific value at index 1 is unknown. The value of `i` is increased by 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid integer, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`, `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`, `i` is increased by 2 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a valid integer, `e` is a list of integers obtained from input, value at index 0 of list `e` is appended to list `p`, `h` is updated with the value at index 1 of list `e`, `i` is increased by 2 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
