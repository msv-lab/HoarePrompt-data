Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid integer, `p` is a list containing at least 3 values obtained from input, `h` is a list containing the values at index 1 of the lists obtained from input. If `p[i] + h[i] < p[i + 1]`, then `pivout` is updated to the sum of the value at index 3 of list `p` and the value at index 3 of list `h`, `cont` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is 3, the loop conditions are satisfied for the next iteration, and `cont` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `pivout` is updated to the value at index 3 of list `p`, `cont` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is 3, and the loop conditions are satisfied for the next iteration.***
