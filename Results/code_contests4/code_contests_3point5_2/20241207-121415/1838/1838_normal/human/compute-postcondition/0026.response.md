Functionality: **The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns True or False based on whether `n` is divisible by any number i or i + 2 where i is a multiple of 6 starting from 5. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False. If none of these conditions are met and `n` is not divisible by any number i or i + 2 where i is a multiple of 6 starting from 5, the function returns True.**
