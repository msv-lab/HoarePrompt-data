Example Answer:
`file.flush()` is called which flushes the internal buffer of the file object. Since the 'flush' key has been removed from kwargs, there are no additional parameters required for the flush method. The file object's internal buffer is now flushed. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, all elements in `args` have been written to the `file` object, kwargs does not contain the key 'flush', and the internal buffer of the `file` object has been flushed.
Output State: **`at_start` is False, `args` is not empty, all elements in `args` have been written to the `file` object, kwargs does not contain the key 'flush', and the internal buffer of the `file` object has been flushed**
