According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `at_start` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `args` is not empty and `x` is the first element in the `args` list.
State: **`at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is not empty and `x` is the first element in the `args` list**
