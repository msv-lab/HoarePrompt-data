According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `args` and the current value of `x`. If there are more elements in `args` that have not been iterated over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `args` needs to be considered.
State: **`at_start` is False, for the loop to execute a second time the next element in `args` needs to be considered**
