The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y, p ≤ 10^9. It calculates the result `res` based on the conditions inside the loop and returns this final value after the loop terminates. The loop processes bitwise operations on `y` and updates `res`, `x`, and `y` accordingly until `y` becomes 0. The function operates within the constraints specified for the parameters x, y, and p.
