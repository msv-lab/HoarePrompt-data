The function `func_16` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It continuously swaps the values of `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. During each swap, `y` is updated to the remainder of the previous value of `x` divided by the previous value of `y`. The final value of `x` after these swaps is returned as the output. The functionality does not handle cases where `y` is initially 0, which could lead to a potential division by zero error.
