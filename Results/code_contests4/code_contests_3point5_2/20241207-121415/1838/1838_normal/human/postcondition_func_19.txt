The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and writes the elements in `args` to an output stream. It separates elements by the value of `sep` or space if not provided. It writes a newline character by default at the end. If 'flush' key is present in the keyword arguments, it flushes the internal buffer of the output stream.
