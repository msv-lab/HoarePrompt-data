You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Yura is tasked to build a closed fence in shape of an arbitrary non-degenerate simple quadrilateral. He's already got three straight fence segments with known lengths a, b, and c. Now he needs to find out some possible integer length d of the fourth straight fence segment so that he can build the fence using these four segments. In other words, the fence should have a quadrilateral shape with side lengths equal to a, b, c, and d. Help Yura, find any possible length of the fourth side.

A non-degenerate simple quadrilateral is such a quadrilateral that no three of its corners lie on the same line, and it does not cross itself.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). The next t lines describe the test cases.

Each line contains three integers a, b, and c — the lengths of the three fence segments (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

Output

For each test case print a single integer d — the length of the fourth fence segment that is suitable for building the fence. If there are multiple answers, print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Example

Input


2
1 2 3
12 34 56


Output


4
42

Note

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 1, 2, 3, 4.

We can build a quadrilateral with sides 12, 34, 56, 42.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
