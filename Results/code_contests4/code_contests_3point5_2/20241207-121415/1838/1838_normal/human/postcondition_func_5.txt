The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, then starts a new thread targeting the `main` function. This function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value. The annotations specify that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 1 and 10^9, but these variables are not utilized within the function.
