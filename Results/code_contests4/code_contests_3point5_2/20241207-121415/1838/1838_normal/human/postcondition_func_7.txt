The function accepts a list 'l' containing three integers representing fence segment lengths. It sorts the list in descending order based on a custom key function 'getKey' and returns the sorted list. The function assumes that the input list 'l' will always contain three integers. If the input list contains more or fewer than three integers, the function may not behave as expected.
