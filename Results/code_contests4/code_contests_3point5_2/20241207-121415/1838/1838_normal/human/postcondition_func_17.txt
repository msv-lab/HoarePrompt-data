The function `func_18` sets up the standard input and output to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. It is supposed to accept three parameters a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. However, the function does not explicitly return any value, and its actual functionality beyond the file redirection setup is not specified. It lacks clarity on what it should do with the input parameters.
