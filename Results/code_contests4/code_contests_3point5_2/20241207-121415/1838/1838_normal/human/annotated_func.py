def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object created by applying the 'int' function to each element after splitting the input string by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer using the 'int' function, and returns a map object with the converted integers. The code does not handle any errors that may occur during the conversion or input reading process.

    #The program returns a map object that applies the str function to each element of the input after stripping and splitting it by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, strips leading and trailing whitespaces, splits the input by spaces, and returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element of the input.

def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by calling the function func_3()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. The program returns a list generated by calling the function `func_3()`. The functionality of the function `func_5` is accurately described by the annotations provided.

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, then starts a new thread targeting the `main` function. This function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value. The annotations specify that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 1 and 10^9, but these variables are not utilized within the function.

    #The program returns the list 'l' sorted in descending order based on the custom key function 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list 'l' containing three integers representing fence segment lengths. It sorts the list in descending order based on a custom key function 'getKey' and returns the sorted list. The function assumes that the input list 'l' will always contain three integers.

    #The program returns True if x is a power of 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_10 accepts a parameter x and returns True if x is a power of 2; otherwise, it returns False. Specifically, it checks if x is a power of 2 by performing a bitwise operation.

        #The program returns the result of integer division of x by y plus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, it returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the result of the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1.

    return res
    #The program returns the final value of 'res' after the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y, p ≤ 10^9. It calculates the result `res` based on the conditions inside the loop and returns this final value after the loop terminates. The loop processes bitwise operations on `y` and updates `res`, `x`, and `y` accordingly until `y` becomes 0. The function operates within the constraints specified for the parameters x, y, and p.

    #The program returns the final value of variable 'x' after swapping 'x' and 'y' multiple times until 'y' becomes 0, where 'y' is updated to the remainder of the previous 'x' divided by the previous 'y'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It continuously swaps the values of `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. During each swap, `y` is updated to the remainder of the previous value of `x` divided by the previous value of `y`. The final value of `x` after these swaps is returned as the output. The functionality does not handle cases where `y` is initially 0, which could lead to a potential division by zero error.

    return True
    #The program returns True if n is not divisible by any number i or i + 2 where i is a multiple of 6 starting from 5, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns True or False based on whether `n` is divisible by any number i or i + 2 where i is a multiple of 6 starting from 5. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns False. If none of these conditions are met and `n` is not divisible by any number i or i + 2 where i is a multiple of 6 starting from 5, the function returns True.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` sets up the standard input and output to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt'. It is supposed to accept three parameters a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. However, the function does not explicitly return any value, and its actual functionality beyond the file redirection setup is not specified. It lacks clarity on what it should do with the input parameters.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: a, b, and c are assigned the return values of func_3() after all iterations of the loop have finished
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` iterates over a range of values returned by `func_1`, assigns the return values of `func_3` to variables a, b, and c, and calls `func_20` with the value of c increased by 1. The function does not calculate the sum of the squares of three integers a, b, and c as stated in the annotations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and writes the elements in `args` to an output stream. It separates elements by the value of `sep` or space if not provided. It writes a newline character by default at the end. If 'flush' key is present in the keyword arguments, it flushes the internal buffer of the output stream.
