Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of bullets required to kill all monsters. The logic inside the for loop where the damage is calculated and shots are counted seems incorrect. Additionally, the method of calculating the start variable is also not accurate.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
7 15
2 14
5 3
```
The correct output should be 6 bullets, but the program may not give the correct result for this case. 

Therefore, the program needs to be revised to accurately calculate the minimum number of bullets required.
