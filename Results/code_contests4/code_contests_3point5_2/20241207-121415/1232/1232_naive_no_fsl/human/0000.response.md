Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of bullets required to kill all monsters in each test case. It iterates through each monster, calculates the damage needed to kill the current monster and updates the total number of bullets required. It also considers the explosion damage when a monster dies. The program keeps track of the minimum starting health of the monsters to ensure the correct calculation of bullets required. The logic seems sound and handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
