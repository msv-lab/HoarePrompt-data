The function `func` reads input from standard input, processes the data according to the provided algorithm, and writes the results to standard output. It calculates and stores specific values based on the input data, but it does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function is designed to handle multiple iterations defined by the input data and perform computations accordingly, with the final results being written to standard output.
