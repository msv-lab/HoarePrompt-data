Example Answer:
`mnShots` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `start` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `monsters[0][0] - dam`, for the loop to execute one more time `t` must be less than `T`, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, `_i` is increased by 1, `monsters` is an empty list, `mnShots` is 0**
