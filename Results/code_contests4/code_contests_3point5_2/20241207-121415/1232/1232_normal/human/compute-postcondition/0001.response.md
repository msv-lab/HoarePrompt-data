Example Answer:
`stdout` is assigned a new BytesIO object. The previous state of the program variables is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object.
Output State: **`stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object**
