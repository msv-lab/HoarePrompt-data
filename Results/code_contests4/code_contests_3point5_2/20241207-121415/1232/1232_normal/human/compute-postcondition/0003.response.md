Example Answer:
`inp` is assigned the value of reading all lines from `stdin`. The `stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, so `inp` will contain all lines from the input. `stdout` remains a new BytesIO object, and `res` remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` contains all lines from the input.
Output State: **`stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` contains all lines from the input**
