Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `start` is the maximum integer value, `monsters` contains the map object `cur`, `mnShots` is 0, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, `_i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, `cur` is a map object containing the integer values from the split input at index `_i`, `n` is greater than 0, `dam` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the `n-1`-th element of `monsters`.**
