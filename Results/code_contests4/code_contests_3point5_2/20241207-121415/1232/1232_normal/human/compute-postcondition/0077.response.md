Output State: **After the loop executes, `stdin`, `stdout`, `inp`, `T`, `_i`, `N`, `monsters`, `start`, `n`, `cur`, `dam`, and `t` retain their final values. `dam` is a non-negative number. `mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. `start` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `monsters[0][0] - dam`. The result of `mnShots + start` is appended to `res`.**
