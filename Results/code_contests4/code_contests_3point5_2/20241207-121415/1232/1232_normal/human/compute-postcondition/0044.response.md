Output State: **`stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` contains the result of `mnShots + start`, `inp` contains all lines from the input, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is equal to the total number of lines in `inp`, `N` is assigned the first integer value from the input, `monsters` contains all `cur` values appended in each iteration of the loop, `mnShots` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the differences between the first elements of each `cur` and the second elements of the previous `cur` in `monsters`, `start` is updated as described above, `n` is equal to `N - 1`, `cur` contains the last set of integers mapped from the input line at index `_i`, `dam` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the second-to-last element in `monsters`, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, for the loop to execute one more time `t` must be less than `T`, `N` is assigned the first integer value from the input, `_i` is incremented by 1.**
