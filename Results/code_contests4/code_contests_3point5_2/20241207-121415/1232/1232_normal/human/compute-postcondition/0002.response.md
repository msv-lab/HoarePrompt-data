Example Answer: 
A list `res` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list.
Output State: **`stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list**
