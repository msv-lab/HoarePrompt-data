Postcondition: ***`t`, `start`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `_i`, `cur`, `n`, `dam` are adjusted. `_i` is increased by 1. `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i]`. `n` is adjusted. `dam` is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. If `n` > 0, `t`, `start`, `monsters` are updated, `mnShots` is increased by the value of `dam`, `cur` is added to `monsters`, `dam` is recalculated.***
