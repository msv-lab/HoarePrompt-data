Postcondition: ***`t`, `start`, `mnShots`, `_i` are increased by 2, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i+1]`, `n` is less than `N`, `dam` is adjusted for the loop to execute a second time, `monsters` contains the newly appended element `cur`. If `n` > 0, `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last element of the list `monsters`, `mnShots` is increased by `dam`, `start` is assigned the minimum value between `start` and the difference between the first element of `cur` and `dam`.***
