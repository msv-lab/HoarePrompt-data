Example Answer:
`cur` is appended to the `monsters` list. The other variables retain their initial values. `n` is increased by 2, so the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, `stdin`, `stdout`, `res`, `inp`, `T`, `N`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `start`, `cur`, `t` retain their initial values. `dam` is recalculated, `n` is increased by 2.
