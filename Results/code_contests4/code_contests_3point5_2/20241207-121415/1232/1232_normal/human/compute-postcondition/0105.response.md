Example Answer:
The variable `dam` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last element of the list `monsters`. The variables `cur`, `n`, and `monsters` are affected by this operation. The value of `cur` is the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i+1]`, `n` is less than `N`, and `monsters` contains the newly appended element `cur`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `start`, `mnShots`, `_i` is increased by 2, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i+1]`, `n` is less than `N`, `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last element of the list `monsters`, `monsters` contains the newly appended element `cur`.
Output State: **`t`, `start`, `mnShots`, `_i` is increased by 2, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i+1]`, `n` is less than `N`, `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last element of the list `monsters`, `monsters` contains the newly appended element `cur`**
