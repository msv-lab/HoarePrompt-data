Example Answer:
`mnShots` is incremented by the value of `dam`. The previous value of `dam` is unknown, so the new value of `mnShots` will depend on the new value of `dam`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables retain their values except for `dam`, which is recalculated based on the specified formula.
Output State: **All variables retain their values except for `dam`, which is recalculated based on the specified formula**
