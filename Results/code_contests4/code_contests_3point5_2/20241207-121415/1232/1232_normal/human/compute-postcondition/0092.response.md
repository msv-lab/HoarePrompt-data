Postcondition: ***`t`, `start`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `N`, `_i`, `cur`, `n`, `dam` are all variables. If n > 0, `t` is incremented by 1, `start` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `start` and `cur[0] - dam`, `monsters` still contains the map object `cur`, `mnShots` is incremented based on the calculated value of `dam`, `N` is assigned the value of `int(inp[_i])`, `_i` is increased by 1, `cur` is the map object containing the integer values from the split input at index `_i`, `n` is greater than 0, and `dam` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the `n-1`-th element of `monsters`.***
