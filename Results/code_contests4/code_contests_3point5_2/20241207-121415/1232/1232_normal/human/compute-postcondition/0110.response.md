Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop, `t` is incremented by 1, `start` is the minimum value between the original `start` and the difference between the first element of the last element of `monsters` and a calculated value, `monsters` contains all the mapped integer elements from the input, `mnShots` is the sum of all the calculated `dam` values, `N` is assigned the value of the last integer from the input, `_i` is increased by `N`, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of the last input, `n` is equal to `N-1`, and `dam` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between the first element of `cur` and the second element of the last element of `monsters`.**
