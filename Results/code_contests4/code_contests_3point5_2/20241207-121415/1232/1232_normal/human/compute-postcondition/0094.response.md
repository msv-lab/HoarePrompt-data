Example Answer:
`cur` is assigned the value of mapping each element of `inp[_i]` to an integer. The values of `_i` and `inp` are adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, but the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is adjusted, `start` is adjusted, `monsters` is adjusted, `mnShots` is adjusted, `_i` is adjusted, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i]`, `n` is adjusted, `dam` is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`t` is adjusted, `start` is adjusted, `monsters` is adjusted, `mnShots` is adjusted, `_i` is adjusted, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i]`, `n` is adjusted, `dam` is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time**
