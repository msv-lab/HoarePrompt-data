Postcondition: ***`stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` contains all lines from the input, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is 4, `N` is assigned the first integer value from the input and greater than 0, `monsters` contains `cur` appended. If `n` is greater than 0, `dam` is the calculated value, `mnShots` is increased by the value of `dam`, and `start` is reassigned to the minimum value between `start` and `cur[0] - dam`.***
