Example Answer:
The variable `_i` is assigned the value 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` contains all lines from the input, `T` is assigned the integer value of the first line in `inp`, `_i` is 1.
Output State: **`stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` is an empty list, `inp` contains all lines from the input, `T` is assigned the integer value of the first line in `inp`, `_i` is 1**
