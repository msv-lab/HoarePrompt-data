Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `stdin` is a BytesIO object containing input from standard input, `stdout` is a new BytesIO object, `res` contains the result of `mnShots + start`, `inp` contains all lines from the input, `T` is greater than 0, `_i` is equal to the total number of lines in `inp`, `N` is greater than 0, `monsters` contains a list with `cur` appended to it, `mnShots` is equal to `dam`, `start` is the minimum value between the current value of `start` and `cur[0] - dam`, `n` is equal to `N - 1`, `cur` is a list containing integers extracted from `inp[_i].split()`, `dam` is the calculated maximum value, `t` is 0, and for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0.***
