Example Answer:
The `map` function is used to convert the elements of `inp[_i]` to integers and assign them to `cur`. The previous states of the variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `start`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `_i` is increased by 1, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i]`, `n` is less than `N`, `dam` is adjusted for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`t`, `start`, `monsters`, `mnShots`, `_i` is increased by 1, `cur` is assigned the mapped integer elements of `inp[_i]`, `n` is less than `N`, `dam` is adjusted for the loop to execute a second time**
