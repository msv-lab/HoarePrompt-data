Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum possible height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes. It follows the logic as described in the problem statement, where the i-th level of the pyramid must have 1 + 2 + ... + (i - 1) + i cubes. The program iterates through the levels of the pyramid, subtracting the required cubes for each level from the total number of cubes given to Vanya until it is not possible to build the next level. Finally, it prints the maximum possible height of the pyramid. 

The program handles all potential cases where the number of cubes given to Vanya can be used to build the pyramid according to the given rules. Since the logic in the program aligns with the problem description and there are no cases identified where the program fails to provide the correct output, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
