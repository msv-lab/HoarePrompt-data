The function `func` reads an integer `x` from the user, then iterates using a loop until `x` becomes negative. During each iteration, it updates `i`, `x`, `c`, and `k` accordingly. Finally, it prints the total number of loop iterations `c`. The function does not accept any explicit parameters and relies solely on the input `x` provided by the user.
