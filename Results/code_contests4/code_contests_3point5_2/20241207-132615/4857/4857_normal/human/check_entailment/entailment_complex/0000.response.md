Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` from the user, then iterates using a loop until the remaining cubes `x` becomes negative. During each iteration, it updates the variables `i`, `x`, `c`, and `k` according to the rules of building the pyramid. Finally, it prints the maximum possible height of the pyramid which is stored in the variable `c`. The program always calculates and outputs the correct maximum height of the pyramid based on the given number of cubes.
