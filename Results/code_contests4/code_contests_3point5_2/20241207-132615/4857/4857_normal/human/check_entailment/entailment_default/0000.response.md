Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads an integer `x` from the user and then iterates using a while loop until `x` becomes negative. In each iteration, it updates `i`, `x`, `c`, and `k` according to the formula given in the problem description. Finally, it prints the total number of loop iterations `c`, which represents the maximum possible height of the pyramid that can be built using the given cubes. The code covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
