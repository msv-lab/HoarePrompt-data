The program correctly calculates the maximum possible height of the pyramid using the given cubes. It iterates through the levels of the pyramid, adding the required number of cubes for each level until it runs out of cubes. The final value of `c` is then printed, which represents the maximum height of the pyramid.

The program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified range.
