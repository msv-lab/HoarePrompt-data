Example Answer:
The value of `x` is updated to `x - i`, where `i` is increased by 4. The value of `i` is unknown initially. Since `x` is dependent on `i`, the exact value of `x` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `i`. Hence, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is updated to x - i - k, `i` is increased by 4, `k` is 3, `c` is 2, for the loop to execute again `x - (i + k) >= 0` must hold true.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is updated to x - i - k, `i` is increased by 4, `k` is 3, `c` is 2, for the loop to execute again `x - (i + k) >= 0` must hold true**
