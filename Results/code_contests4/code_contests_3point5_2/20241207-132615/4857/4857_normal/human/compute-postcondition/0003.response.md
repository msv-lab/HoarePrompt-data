Example Answer:
The variable `c` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is assigned the value 1; `c` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0; `k` is assigned the value 1; `c` is 0**
