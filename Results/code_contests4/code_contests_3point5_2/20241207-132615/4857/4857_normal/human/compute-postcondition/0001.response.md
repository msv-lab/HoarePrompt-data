Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0**
