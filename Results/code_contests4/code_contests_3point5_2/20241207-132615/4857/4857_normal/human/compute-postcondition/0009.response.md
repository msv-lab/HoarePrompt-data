According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the expression `x - (i + k)`. If the result of this expression is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 2, `k` is 2, and `c` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted so that the expression `x - (i + k)` is greater than or equal to 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is an updated value, `i` is increased by 2, `k` is 2, `c` is 1, for the loop to execute again the condition `x - (i + k) >= 0` must hold true**
