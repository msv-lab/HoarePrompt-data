Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `x - i`, where `i` is increased by `k` which is 1. So, `x` will be updated based on the previous values of `x` and `i`. The value of `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is an updated value, `i` is increased by `k`, `k` is 1, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is an updated value, `i` is increased by `k`, `k` is 1, `c` is 0**
