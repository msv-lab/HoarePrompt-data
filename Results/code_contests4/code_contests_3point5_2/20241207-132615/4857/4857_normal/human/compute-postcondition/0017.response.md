Example Answer:
Initially, `c` is increased by 1. The value of `c` is 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The loop will execute again as `x - (i + k) >= 0` holds true. The values of `n`, `x`, `i`, and `k` remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is updated to x - i - k, `i` is increased by 4, `k` is 3, `c` is 3**
