Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 1, so its value changes from 3 to 4. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is updated to x - i - k, `i` is increased by 4, `k` is 4, `c` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is updated to x - i - k, `i` is increased by 4, `k` is 4, `c` is 3**
