Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is between 1 and 10^4, so `x` will be within the same range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer**
