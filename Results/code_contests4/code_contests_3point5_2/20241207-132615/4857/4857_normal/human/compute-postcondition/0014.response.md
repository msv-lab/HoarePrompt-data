According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x`, `i`, and `k`. If `x - (i + k) >= 0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is updated and `i` is increased by 4, `k` is 3, and `c` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated to `x - i` and `i` increased by 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, `x` is updated to x - i, `i` is increased by 4, `k` is 3, `c` is 2, for the loop to execute again `x - (i + k) >= 0` must hold true**
