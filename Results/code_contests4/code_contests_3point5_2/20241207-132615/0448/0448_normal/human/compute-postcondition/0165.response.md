According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and the value at index `pidx` of list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, the values are as follows: `works` is a boolean, `pidx` is an integer, `hidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is updated to max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is updated to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the conditions `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must be satisfied. Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted:

1. Ensure that `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`.
2. Ensure that the value at index `pidx` of list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`.

State: **`works` is a boolean, `pidx` is an integer less than len(p), `hidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is updated to max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is updated to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**.
