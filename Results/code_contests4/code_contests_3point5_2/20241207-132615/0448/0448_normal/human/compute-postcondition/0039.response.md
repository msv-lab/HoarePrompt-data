Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than len(h), `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`, `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the integer division of the difference between `avg` and `leftime` by 2, `furthestright` is calculated as the sum of `curpos` and the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`.**
