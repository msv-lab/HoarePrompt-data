According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, and `avg` remain unchanged. `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above. `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `furthestright` is updated as described above. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `furthestright` is updated as described above, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
