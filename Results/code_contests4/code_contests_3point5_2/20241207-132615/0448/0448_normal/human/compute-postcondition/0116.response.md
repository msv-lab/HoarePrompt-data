According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values and `pidx` has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, `pidx` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**.
