Example Answer:
`curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. The values of `h`, `hidx`, and `curpos` are affected, but the previous values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` must be less than len(h) and `pidx` must be less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
Output State: **`pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` must be less than len(h) and `pidx` must be less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`**
