Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pidx` is unknown. The loop will execute again if `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to `furthestright`. Therefore, the Output State is: Cannot determine the exact output state due to missing value of `remtime`, for the loop to execute again `pidx` should be less than len(p) and p[pidx] should be less than or equal to `furthestright`.
Output State: **Cannot determine the exact output state due to missing value of `remtime`, for the loop to execute again `pidx` should be less than len(p) and p[pidx] should be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
