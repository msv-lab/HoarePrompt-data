Example Answer:
`hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or equal to the length of `p`, `hidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or equal to the length of `p`, `hidx` is incremented by 1**
