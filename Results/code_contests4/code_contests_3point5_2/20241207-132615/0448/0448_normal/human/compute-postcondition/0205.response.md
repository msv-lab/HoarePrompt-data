According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `avg` remain unchanged. `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `furthestright` are updated. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `furthestright` needs to be updated based on the new values.

State: **`pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `furthestright` is updated, for the loop to execute the next time `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
