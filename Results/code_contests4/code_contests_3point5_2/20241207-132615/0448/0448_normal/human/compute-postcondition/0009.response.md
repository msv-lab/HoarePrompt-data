According to the code, the loop can execute if both `hidx` is less than the length of list `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`. Right before the loop, `hidx` is 0 and `pidx` is 0. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute the first time, the lengths of lists `h` and `p` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `hidx` and `pidx` need to be adjusted to be less than the lengths of lists `h` and `p` respectively.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is True, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the lengths of lists h and p are greater than 0, and hidx is less than len(h) and pidx is less than len(p)**
