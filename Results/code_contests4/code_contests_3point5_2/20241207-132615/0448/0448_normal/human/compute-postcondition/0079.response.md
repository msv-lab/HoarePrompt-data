Example Answer:
`hidx` is assigned the value 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: If `works` is True, and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0.
Output State: **If `works` is True, and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0**
