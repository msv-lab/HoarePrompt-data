According to the code, the loop can execute another time if `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to the variable `furthestright`. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as described. To execute the loop one more time, `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1, and if the loop is to be executed, the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` must still hold. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are as described above; for the loop to execute the next time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright, `pidx` is incremented by 1**
