According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx` and `pidx`. If `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is still less than `len(h)`, and `pidx` is equal to `len(p)`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is still less than `len(h)`, `pidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`**
