Postcondition: ***If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1. If `pidx` is not equal to len(p) and `works` is False, then `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values***
