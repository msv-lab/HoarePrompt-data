Postcondition: ***`works` is a boolean, `pidx` is an integer, `hidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. If the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited.***
