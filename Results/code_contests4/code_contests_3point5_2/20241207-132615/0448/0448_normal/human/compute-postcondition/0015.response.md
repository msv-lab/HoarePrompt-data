Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value. If `curpos` minus `leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is False and we exit the inner loop or if statement.***
