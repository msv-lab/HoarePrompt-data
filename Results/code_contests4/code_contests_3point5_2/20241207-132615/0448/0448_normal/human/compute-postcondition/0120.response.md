According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `hidx` and `pidx`. If both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, `pidx` has been incremented to a value where `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, and `hidx` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `hidx` needs to be less than the length of `h` and `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, `pidx` has been incremented to a value where `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than len(h) and `pidx` is less than len(p)**
