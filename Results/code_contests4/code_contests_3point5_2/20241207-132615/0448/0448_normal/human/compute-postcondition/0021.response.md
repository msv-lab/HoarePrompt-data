According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is calculated based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Ensure that `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.
- Ensure that the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to the recalculated value of `furthestright`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is calculated based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
