Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are as described above; for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright, `pidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are as described above; for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright, `pidx` is incremented by 1**
