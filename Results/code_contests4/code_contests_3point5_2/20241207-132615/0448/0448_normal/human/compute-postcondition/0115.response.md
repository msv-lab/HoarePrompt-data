Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute one more time as long as `pidx` is less than the length of the list `p` and the value at index `pidx` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, `pidx` has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, `pidx` has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop**
