According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ss` and `ll`. If `ss` is less than `ll`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ss` is 0 and `ll` is 21000000000. Since `ss` is already less than `ll`, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000 for the loop to execute the first time**
