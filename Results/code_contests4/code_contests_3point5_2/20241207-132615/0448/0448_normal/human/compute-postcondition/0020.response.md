Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `leftime` is calculated based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`, `remtime` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`, `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
