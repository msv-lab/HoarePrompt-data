Postcondition: ***`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than len(h), `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`. If `curpos - leftget > avg`, `works` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
