Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `furthestright` is updated as described above, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
