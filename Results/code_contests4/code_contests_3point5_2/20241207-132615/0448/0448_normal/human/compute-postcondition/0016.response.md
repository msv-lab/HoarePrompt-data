Example Answer: 
`getbacktime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `hi`, `pi`, `ss`, `ll`, `avg`, and `works` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer**
