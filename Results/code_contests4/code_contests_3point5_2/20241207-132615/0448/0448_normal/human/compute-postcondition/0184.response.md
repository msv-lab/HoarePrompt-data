According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. The loop will execute if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in array `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. Right before the loop, the exact output state cannot be determined due to the missing value of `remtime`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `pidx` should be less than the length of `p`.
2. The element at index `pidx` in array `p` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`.
3. The value of `remtime` should be provided to determine the exact output state.

State: **Cannot determine the exact output state due to missing value of `remtime`. To execute the loop the first time, `pidx` should be less than the length of `p`, the element at index `pidx` in array `p` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`, and `remtime` should be provided.**
