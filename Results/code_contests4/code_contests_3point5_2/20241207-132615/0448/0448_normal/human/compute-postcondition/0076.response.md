According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ss` and `ll`. If `ss` is less than `ll`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), then `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. If `works` is False, then `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`. No other variables are affected. So, to execute the loop one more time, `ss` needs to be less than `ll`.
