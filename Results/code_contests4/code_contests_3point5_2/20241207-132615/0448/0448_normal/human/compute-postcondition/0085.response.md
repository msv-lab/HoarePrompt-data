Output State: If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx`, `pidx`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is assigned the value 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `leftget` is assigned the value `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value `h[hidx]`, `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`.
