According to the code, the loop can execute if both `pidx` is less than the length of list `p` and the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Right before the loop, the values are:
- `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`
- `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`
- `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of the integer division of the difference between `avg` and `leftime` by 2
- `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`

For the loop to execute the first time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Ensure that `pidx` is less than the length of list `p`
- Ensure that the value at index `pidx` in list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are as described above; for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
