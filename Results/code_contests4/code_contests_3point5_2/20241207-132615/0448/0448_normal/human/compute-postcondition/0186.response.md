According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. Since the exact output state cannot be determined due to the missing value of `remtime`, we need to focus on `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `pidx` should be less than the length of `p`.
2. The element at index `pidx` in `p` should be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

No other states need to be adjusted in this case.
State: **Cannot determine the exact output state due to missing value of `remtime`, for the loop to execute again `pidx` should be less than len(p) and p[pidx] should be less than or equal to `furthestright`**
