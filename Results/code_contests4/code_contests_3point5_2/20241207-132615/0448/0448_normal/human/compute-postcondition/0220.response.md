Output State: **If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), then `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. If `works` is False, then `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1` and no other variables are affected. After the loop finishes, the final values of `ss`, `ll`, `avg`, `works`, `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` will depend on the conditions met during the loop execution.**
