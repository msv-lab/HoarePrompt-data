Example Answer:
The input is being split and mapped to integers and then stored in list `p`. The values of `n`, `m`, `hi`, and `pi` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5. `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5. `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1**
