Example Answer:
The value of `hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, `pidx` remain the same as described in the initial state; `hidx` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, `pidx` remain the same as described in the initial state; `hidx` is increased by 1**
