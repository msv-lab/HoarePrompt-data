Output State: **If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1. If `works` is False and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. `ll` is assigned the value `avg`. If `works` is False and `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1`. For the loop to execute again `ss` should be less than `ll + 1, `avg` is calculated as (ss + ll) // 2**
