Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the value `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, which calculates the time it takes to move left based on the current position and the target position. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `works` is a boolean, `pidx` is equal to len(p) or greater, `hidx` is an integer incremented by 2 or more, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is recalculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime).
Output State: **`works` is a boolean, `pidx` is equal to len(p) or greater, `hidx` is an integer incremented by 2 or more, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is recalculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime)**
