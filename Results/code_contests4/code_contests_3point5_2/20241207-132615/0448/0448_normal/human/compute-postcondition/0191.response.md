Example Answer:
`hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so after execution, `hidx` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is the index of the first element in p that is greater than furthestright or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`pidx` is the index of the first element in p that is greater than furthestright or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1**
