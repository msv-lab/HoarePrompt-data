According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`. At the end of the previous iteration, `hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than len(h), `pidx` is less than len(p) and incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated, `alsotoright` is assigned, `works` is set to False, `remtime` is assigned, `furthestright` is calculated. For the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be less than len(p) and `p[pidx]` needs to be less than or equal to `furthestright`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than len(h), `pidx` is less than len(p) and incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated, `alsotoright` is assigned, `works` is set to False, `remtime` is assigned, `furthestright` is calculated, for the loop to execute one more time `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright**.
