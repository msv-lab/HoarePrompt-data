Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
