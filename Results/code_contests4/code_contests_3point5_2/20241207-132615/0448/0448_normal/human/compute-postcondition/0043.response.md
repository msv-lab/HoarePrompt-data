Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than len(h), `pidx` is less than len(p) and incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated, `alsotoright` is assigned, `works` is set to False, `remtime` is assigned, `furthestright` is calculated, for the loop to execute one more time `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright.**
