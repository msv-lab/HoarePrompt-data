Example Answer:
The value of `leftime` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of `curpos - leftget`. Since the initial state values of `curpos` and `leftget` are not provided, the output state will be dependent on those values. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, and `leftime` is calculated based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000, `works` is a boolean value, `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer, `alsotoright` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, and `leftime` is calculated based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`**
