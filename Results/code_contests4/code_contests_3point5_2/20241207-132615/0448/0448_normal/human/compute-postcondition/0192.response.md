According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx`, `pidx`, `h`, and `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, both `hidx` must be less than the length of `h` and `pidx` must be less than the length of `p`. At the end of the previous iteration, `pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists, and `hidx` is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted such that `hidx` is still less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`.
State: **`pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` must be less than len(h) and `pidx` must be less than len(p)**
