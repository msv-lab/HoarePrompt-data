Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pidx` is unknown, so after execution, `pidx` is increased by 1. The value of `furthestright` is not provided, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is incremented by 1, `furthestright` needs to be recalculated.
Output State: **`pidx` is incremented by 1, `furthestright` needs to be recalculated**
