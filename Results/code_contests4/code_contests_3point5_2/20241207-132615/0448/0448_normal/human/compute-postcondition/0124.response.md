Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos` are assigned values, `p[pidx]` has been incremented to a value where `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than len(h) and `pidx` is less than len(p), `works` is False**.
