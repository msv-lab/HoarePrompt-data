Example Answer: 
`remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of the integer division of the difference between `avg` and `leftime` by 2. The initial values of `avg`, `curpos`, `leftget`, and `leftime` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `remtime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`; `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of the integer division of the difference between `avg` and `leftime` by 2.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`; `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of the integer division of the difference between `avg` and `leftime` by 2**
