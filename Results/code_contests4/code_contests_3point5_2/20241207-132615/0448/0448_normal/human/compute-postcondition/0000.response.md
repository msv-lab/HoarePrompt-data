Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`. The `input().split()` function accepts input and splits it into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then maps each element of the list to an integer. Since the values of `n` and `m` depend on user input, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5. hi and pi are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1.**
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5. hi and pi are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1.**
