According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order.
- `ss` is 0.
- `ll` is 21000000000.
- `avg` is 10500000000.
- `works` is a boolean value.
- `getbacktime` is a non-negative integer.
- `alsotoright` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`.
- `leftime` is calculated based on the values of `curpos` and `leftget`.
- `remtime` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`.
- `furthestright` is calculated as `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `furthestright` needs to be recalculated based on the updated values.
- No other states need adjustment.

State: **At the end of the previous iteration, the states need to be adjusted by incrementing `pidx` by 1 and recalculating `furthestright` for the loop to execute one more time.**
