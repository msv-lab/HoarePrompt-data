Postcondition: ***`works` is either True or False. If `pidx` is not equal to len(p), and `works` is False, then `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables. Additionally, if `works` is False, then the program does not enter the if block and instead enters the else block.***
