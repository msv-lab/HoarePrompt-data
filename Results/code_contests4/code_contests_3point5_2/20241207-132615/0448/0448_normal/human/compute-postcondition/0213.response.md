Output State: **`works` is False, `pidx` is len(p) or greater, `hidx` is incremented by the number of elements in `h`, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos` is the last value of `h`, `getbacktime` is max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, and `pidx` is not equal to len(p)**.
