According to the code, the loop can execute if `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`. 

Right before the loop, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the list `p`.
- `leftget` needs to be updated to the value at index `pidx` in the list `p`.
- `curpos` needs to be updated to the value at index `hidx` in the list `h`.
- `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime` and `furthestright` need to be recalculated based on the updated values of `leftget`, `curpos`, `avg` and other mentioned calculations.

State: **If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx`, `pidx`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is assigned the value 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `leftget` is assigned the value `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value `h[hidx]`, if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `getbacktime` is assigned the value `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is updated based on the calculation mentioned, `leftime` is assigned the value `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is assigned the value `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, `furthestright` is assigned the value `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` and `pidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` recalculated based on the updated values**
