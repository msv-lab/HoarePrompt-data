According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. 

Right before the loop, `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright` are assigned values. For the loop to execute the first time, `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `pidx` needs to be less than the length of `p`
- The value at index `pidx` in `p` must be less than or equal to `furthestright`

State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright**
