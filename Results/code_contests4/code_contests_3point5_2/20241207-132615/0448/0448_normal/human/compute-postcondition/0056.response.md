Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, where `curpos` and `leftget` have specific values based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is still less than `len(h)`, `pidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index `hidx` of list `c`, if `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`, `leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.
Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is still less than `len(h)`, `pidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index `hidx` of list `c`, if `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and `getbacktime`, `leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`**
