According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by 1. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1 again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are as described above; `pidx` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again**
