Example Answer:
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, where `p` is a list and `pidx` is an index. The value of `pidx` is 1, so `leftget` will be assigned the value of the element at index 1 in list `p`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `works` is True, `pidx` is 1, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values.
Output State: **`works` is True, `pidx` is 1, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values**
