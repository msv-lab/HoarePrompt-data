Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `remtime` is the maximum value between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`. `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`, where the values of `alsotoright`, `leftime`, and `remtime` are calculated based on the initial state values. 
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned a value, `leftime` is assigned a value, `remtime` is assigned a value, `furthestright` is assigned a value based on calculations**
