Example Answer:
`hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the output state is: `remtime` remains the same as the initial state, `furthestright` is assigned to the maximum value between the initial `furthestright` and the final value of `furthestright` calculated in the loop, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` or the index at which the loop exits, `hidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`remtime` remains the same as the initial state, `furthestright` is assigned to the maximum value between the initial `furthestright` and the final value of `furthestright` calculated in the loop, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p` or the index at which the loop exits, `hidx` is incremented by 1**
