Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than len(h), `pidx` is equal to len(p), `leftget` is the value of the last element in p, `curpos` is the value of the last element in h, `getbacktime` is calculated, `alsotoright` is assigned, `works` is set to False, `remtime` is assigned, `furthestright` is calculated, loop control variable `pidx` is equal to len(p) indicating loop termination**
