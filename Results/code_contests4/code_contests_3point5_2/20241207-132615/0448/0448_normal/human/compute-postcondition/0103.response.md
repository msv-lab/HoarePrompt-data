Output State: If `works` is True and `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `pidx` is equal to len(p), `leftget` is the last value of `p`, if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than len(h), `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`.
