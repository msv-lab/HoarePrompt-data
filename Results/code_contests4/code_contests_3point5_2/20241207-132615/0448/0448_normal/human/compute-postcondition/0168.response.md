Output State: **`works` is a boolean, `pidx` is an integer less than len(p) + 1, `hidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is updated to max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is updated to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)` for the loop to execute again `pidx` needs to be less than len(p) and p[pidx] <= furthestright, `pidx` is incremented by 1.**
