According to the code, the loop can execute if both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. Right before the loop, `works` is True, `pidx` is 0, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is either `hidx` or `pidx` needs to be incremented to be less than their respective lengths.
State: **`works` is True, `pidx` is 1, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values**
