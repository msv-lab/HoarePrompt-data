According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `hidx` and `pidx`. If `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `works` is True, `pidx` is equal to the length of `p`, and `hidx` is incremented by 1. This means that for the loop to execute again, `hidx` needs to be less than the length of `h`. So, `hidx` should be adjusted to be less than the length of `h`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **Output State: If `works` is True and `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx` is incremented by 1, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `pidx` is equal to len(p), `leftget` is the last value of `p`, if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than len(h)**
