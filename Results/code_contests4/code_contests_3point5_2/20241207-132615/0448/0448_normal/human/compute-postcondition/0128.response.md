Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, where `curpos` and `leftget` are variables with unknown values. Therefore, the output state is: `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the difference between `avg` and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`**
