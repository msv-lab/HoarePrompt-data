Output State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is still less than `len(h)`, `pidx` is increased by 1, `pidx` is less than `len(p)`, `leftget` is assigned the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index `hidx` of list `h`, if `curpos - leftget > avg`, then `works` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `getbacktime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.**
