Output State: **`works` is a boolean, `pidx` is an integer, `hidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is updated to max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. If the difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited.**
