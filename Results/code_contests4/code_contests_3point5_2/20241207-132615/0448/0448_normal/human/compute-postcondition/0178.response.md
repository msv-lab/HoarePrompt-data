Postcondition: ***`works` is a boolean, `pidx` is equal to len(p) or greater, `hidx` is an integer incremented by 2 or more, `leftget` is the value at index `pidx` of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is updated to max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is updated to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index `h[hidx]`. If `curpos - leftget > avg`, `works` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
