According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in the list `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than the length of `h`, `pidx` is less than the length of `p`, `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated, `alsotoright` is assigned, `works` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `remtime` is assigned, `furthestright` is calculated. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the conditions `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright` need to be satisfied. So, the next iteration would require adjusting `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `works`, `remtime`, and `furthestright` based on the previous values and the logic of the code.

State: **`hidx` is increased by 1, `hidx` is less than len(h), `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx]`, `getbacktime` is calculated, `alsotoright` is assigned, `works` is set to False, `remtime` is assigned, `furthestright` is calculated, for the loop to execute the first time `pidx < len(p)` and `p[pidx] <= furthestright`**
