Postcondition: ***If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), then `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. If `works` is False, then `ss` is assigned the value of `avg + 1` and no other variables are affected.***
