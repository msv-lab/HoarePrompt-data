Example Answer:
`leftime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. Since the value of `leftget` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot calculate the exact value of `leftime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`**
