Example Answer:
`furthestright` is calculated based on the values of `curpos`, `alsotoright`, and `remtime`. The value of `curpos` is the value at index 0 of list `h`. The value of `alsotoright` is calculated as `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`, where `getbacktime` is recalculated as `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`. The value of `remtime` is not provided. Therefore, the final value of `furthestright` cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Cannot determine the exact output state due to missing value of `remtime`.**
