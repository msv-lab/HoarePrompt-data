According to the code, the loop can execute if `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. 

Right before the loop, if `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to the length of `p`, then the loop can potentially execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `hidx` should be less than the length of `h` and `pidx` should be less than the length of `p`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx`, `pidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is assigned the value 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
