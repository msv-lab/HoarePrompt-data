Example Answer:
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, where `pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` must be less than len(h) and `pidx` must be less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
Output State: **`pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` must be less than len(h) and `pidx` must be less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`**
