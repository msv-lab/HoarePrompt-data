According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the value at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and half the difference between `avg` and `leftime`, and `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the values of `pidx` and `p` need to be adjusted such that `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to the new value of `furthestright`.
State: **`remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and half the difference between `avg` and `leftime`; `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`; for the loop to execute the first time, `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`**
