Example Answer:
`furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`. The value of `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`. The previous values of `curpos` and `remtime` are known. Therefore, after execution, `furthestright` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` and `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`, `furthestright` is updated as described above.**
