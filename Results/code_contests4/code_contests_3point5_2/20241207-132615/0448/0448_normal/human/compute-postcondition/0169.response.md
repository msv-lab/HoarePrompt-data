According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `pidx` and `p`. If `pidx` is less than len(p) and p[pidx] is less than or equal to furthestright, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `works` is a boolean, `pidx` is an integer less than len(p) + 1, `hidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is updated to max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is updated to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `pidx` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition `p[pidx] <= furthestright` should still hold true.
State: **`works` is a boolean, `pidx` is an integer less than len(p) + 1 and incremented by 1, `hidx` is an integer, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime` is calculated as max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget)), `alsotoright` is calculated as max(0, avg - getbacktime), `leftime` is updated to max(0, curpos - leftget), `remtime` is assigned the value of max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2), `furthestright` is updated to `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**.
