Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the value of `max(0, avg - getbacktime)`. The values of `avg` and `getbacktime` are dependent on previous calculations and inputs. Therefore, the Output State is: If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx`, `pidx`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is assigned the value 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `leftget` is assigned the value `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value `h[hidx]`, and if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `getbacktime` is assigned the value `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is updated based on the calculation mentioned.
