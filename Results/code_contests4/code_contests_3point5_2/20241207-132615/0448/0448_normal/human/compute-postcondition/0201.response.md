Example Answer:
`remtime` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and the result of `(avg - leftime) // 2`. The values of `leftime` and `avg` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `remtime`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` and `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`.
Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` and `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`**
