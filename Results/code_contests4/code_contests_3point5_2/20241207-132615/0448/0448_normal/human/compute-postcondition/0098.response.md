Output State: If `works` is True and `pidx` is not equal to len(p), `hidx`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is incremented by 1, `leftget` is assigned the value `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value `h[hidx]`, for the loop to execute one more time `p[pidx]` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, `pidx` is increased by 1.
