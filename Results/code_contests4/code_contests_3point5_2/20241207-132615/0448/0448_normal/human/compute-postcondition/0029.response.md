According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `hidx` is less than the length of `h` and `pidx` is less than the length of `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `hidx` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `hidx` should be less than the length of `h` after the increment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `hidx` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than len(h) and pidx is less than len(p)**
