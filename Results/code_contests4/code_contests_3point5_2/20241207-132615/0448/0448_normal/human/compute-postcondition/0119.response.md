Example Answer:
`hidx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hidx` is unknown, so the new value of `hidx` depends on the previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, `pidx` has been incremented to a value where `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `hidx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are assigned values, `pidx` has been incremented to a value where `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `hidx` is incremented by 1**
