Example Answer:
The variable `avg` is assigned the floor division of the sum of `ss` and `ll` divided by 2. Since `ss` is 0 and `ll` is 21000000000, the value of `avg` is 10500000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^5, `hi` and `pi` are distinct integers in ascending order such that 1 <= hi, pi <= 10^10 and hi < hi + 1, pi < pi + 1, `ss` is 0, `ll` is 21000000000, `avg` is 10500000000**
