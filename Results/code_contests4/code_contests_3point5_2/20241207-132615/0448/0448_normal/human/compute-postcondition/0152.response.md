Example Answer:
`pidx` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `works` is True, `pidx` is 0, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values.
Output State: **`works` is True, `pidx` is 0, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values**
