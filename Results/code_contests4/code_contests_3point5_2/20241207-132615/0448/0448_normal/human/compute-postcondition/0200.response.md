Example Answer: 
`leftime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. Since the initial state of the variables is not provided, the final values of `leftime` and other variables cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` and `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`.
