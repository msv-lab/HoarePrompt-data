Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright`, `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` are assigned values. `p[pidx]` has been incremented to a value where `pidx` is greater than or equal to len(p) or `p[pidx]` is greater than `furthestright`, `hidx` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `hidx` is less than len(h) and `pidx` is less than len(p). If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then `works` is False. `getbacktime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`.**
