Example Answer:
`remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and half the difference between `avg` and `leftime`. Then, `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`. The variables `avg`, `leftime`, `curpos`, and `alsotoright` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and half the difference between `avg` and `leftime`; `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`.
Output State: **`remtime` is assigned the maximum of 0 and half the difference between `avg` and `leftime`; `furthestright` is assigned the value of `curpos` plus the maximum value between `alsotoright` and `remtime`**
