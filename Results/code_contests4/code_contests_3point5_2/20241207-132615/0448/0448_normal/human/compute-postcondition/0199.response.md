Example Answer:
`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`. The values of the variables `pidx`, `hidx`, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works`, and `avg` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` and `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`.
Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` and `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above, `alsotoright` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `avg - getbacktime`**
