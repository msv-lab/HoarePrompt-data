Output State: **If `works` is True and `pidx` is equal to len(p), `hidx`, `curpos`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `lefttime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values, `hidx` is 0, `pidx` is equal to len(p), `leftget` is the last value of `p`, `curpos` is the last value of `h`, if `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `getbacktime` is assigned the value `max(0, 2 * (curpos - leftget))`, `alsotoright` is updated based on the calculation mentioned, `leftime` is assigned the value `max(0, curpos - leftget)`, `remtime` is assigned the value `max(0, (avg - leftime) // 2)`, `furthestright` is assigned the value `curpos + max(alsotoright, remtime)`**
