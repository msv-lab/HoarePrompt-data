Example Answer:
`leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, where `pidx` is the index of the list p. The values of `hidx` and `pidx` are not affected, but for the loop to execute again, `hidx` must be less than len(h) and `pidx` must be less than len(p). Therefore, the Output State is: variable `hidx` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than len(h) and `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`.
Output State: **variable `hidx` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` is less than len(h) and `pidx` is less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]**.
