Postcondition: ***`works` is True, `pidx` is 1, `hidx` is 0, `leftget` is the value at index 1 of list `p`, `curpos` is assigned the value at index 0 of list `h`, `getbacktime`, `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` maintain their previous values. The difference between `curpos` and `leftget` is greater than `avg`***
