Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `pidx` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are as described above; `pidx` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`alsotoright`, `leftime`, `remtime`, `furthestright` are as described above; `pidx` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again**
