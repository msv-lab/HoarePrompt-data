Output State: **`pidx` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `furthestright` or `len(p)` if no such element exists, `hidx` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `hidx` must be less than len(h) and `pidx` must be less than len(p), `leftget` is assigned the value of `p[pidx]`, `curpos` is assigned the value of `h[hidx] and `works` is False**
