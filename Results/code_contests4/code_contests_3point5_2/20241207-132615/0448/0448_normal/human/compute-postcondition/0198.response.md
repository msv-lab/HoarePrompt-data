Example Answer:
The value of `getbacktime` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`. If `curpos - leftget` is greater than `avg`, `works` is set to False and the loop breaks out. Otherwise, no changes occur.
Output State: **`pidx`, `hidx` are the indices of elements in `p` and `h` respectively, `leftget`, `curpos`, `works` and `avg` remain unchanged, `getbacktime` is updated based on the calculation described above.**
