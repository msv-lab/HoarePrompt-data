Example Answer: 
`remtime` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`. The value of `avg` is not given in the initial state, so it cannot be calculated. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, and `remtime` is the maximum value between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`.
Output State: **`alsotoright` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and 2 times the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `leftime` is the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `curpos` and `leftget`, `remtime` is the maximum value between 0 and half of the difference between `avg` and `leftime`**
