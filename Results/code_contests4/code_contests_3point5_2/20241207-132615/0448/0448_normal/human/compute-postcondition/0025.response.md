According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pidx`, `p`, and `furthestright`. If `pidx` is less than the length of `p` and the element at index `pidx` in `p` is less than or equal to `furthestright`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `pidx` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `pidx` needs to be further incremented. Additionally, `furthestright` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `p[pidx]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`pidx` is further incremented, `furthestright` needs to be recalculated for the loop to execute again**.
