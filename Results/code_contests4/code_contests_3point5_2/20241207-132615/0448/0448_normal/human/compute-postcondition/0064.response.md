Example Answer:
`pidx` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that all variables are incremented by 1, so `remtime`, `furthestright`, and `pidx` are all now incremented by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `remtime`, `furthestright`, and `pidx` are all incremented by 2.
Output State: **`remtime`, `furthestright`, and `pidx` are all incremented by 2**
