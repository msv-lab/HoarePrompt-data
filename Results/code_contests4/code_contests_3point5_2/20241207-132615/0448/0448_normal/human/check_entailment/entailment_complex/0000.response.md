Correctness: **True**

The annotated program is correct as it follows the problem description accurately. The program reads the input values, performs a binary search algorithm to find the minimum time required to read all the needed tracks, and then prints the result. The binary search algorithm ensures that the tracks are read in the correct order and considers the movement of the heads accurately based on the given constraints. The variables and calculations used in the program align with the problem description, and the final output is the minimum time required to read all the tracks. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
