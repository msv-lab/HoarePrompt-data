Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It then performs a binary search algorithm to find the minimum time required to read all the needed tracks.
- The algorithm checks certain conditions using variables like `works`, `hidx`, and `pidx` to determine if a given time is sufficient to read all tracks.
- The binary search updates the upper and lower bounds (`ll` and `ss`) based on whether the conditions are met or not, until `ss` is no longer less than `ll`.
- The final output is the minimum time required to read all the needed tracks.
- The code seems to be handling all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description, and the output hints also align with the code logic.
