The function `func_1` reads input, performs a binary search algorithm to find a suitable value, and then prints the value of `ss`. The binary search algorithm involves checking certain conditions using the variables `works`, `hidx`, `pidx`, and various calculations. If the conditions are met, `ll` is updated to `avg`; otherwise, `ss` is updated to `avg + 1`. The loop continues until `ss` is no longer less than `ll`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
