Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program does not follow the algorithm of generating the sequence of integers as specified in the problem description. The logic in the program is incorrect and does not produce the expected output for all potential cases.

An example case where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3 2

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output (from the program):
1

Explanation:
In the first sample, the obtained sequence is [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]. The number at the second position is 2, but the program outputs 1. This shows that the program does not follow the problem description and does not produce the correct output for this case.
