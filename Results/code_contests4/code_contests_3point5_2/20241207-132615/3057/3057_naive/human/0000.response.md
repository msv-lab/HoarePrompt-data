Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. It does not generate the sequence as described in the problem statement and does not output the correct value at the k-th position in the obtained sequence.

A counterexample:
Input:
3 2
Output:
This program will output 1 instead of 2. 

Explanation:
For the input 3 2, the obtained sequence should be [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]. The number at the second position should be 2, but the program incorrectly outputs 1. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not produce the correct output for all potential cases.
