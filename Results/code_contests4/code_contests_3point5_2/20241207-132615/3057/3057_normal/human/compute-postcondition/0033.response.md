Postcondition: ***`steps` is an input integer, `index` is an integer value, `left` is 1, and `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1. If `index` is odd, the program condition `(right + left) / 2 != index` is false, loop terminates. If `index` is even, `steps` is 0, `index` is an even integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `index` minus 1, and the program prints the value of `steps`, which is 0.***
