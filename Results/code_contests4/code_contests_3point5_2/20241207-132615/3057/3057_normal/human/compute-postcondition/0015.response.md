Postcondition: ***`steps` is decreased by 1, `index` is an even integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1. The sum of `right` and `left` is not equal to `2*index - 1`. `index` is greater than or equal to (right + left) / 2. `index` is greater than (right + left) / 2***
