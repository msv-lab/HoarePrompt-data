Postcondition: ***`steps` is decreased by 1, `index` is an even integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1. If `index` is less than `(right + left) / 2`, then `right` is updated to a new value. If `index` is greater than or equal to `(right + left) / 2`, then `steps` is decreased by 1, `index` is an even integer, `left` and `right` are updated values, and the condition `(right + left) / 2 != index` still holds true for the loop to execute again.***
