Example Answer:
`steps` is assigned the value `int(steps)`, where `int` converts the input value to an integer. The value of `steps` is dependent on the input provided during runtime. The value of `index` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is an input integer based on user input, `index` is assigned a value based on the input provided during runtime.
Output State: **`steps` is an input integer based on user input, `index` is assigned a value based on the input provided during runtime**
