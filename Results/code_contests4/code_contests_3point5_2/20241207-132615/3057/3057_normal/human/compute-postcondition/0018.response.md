Postcondition: ***`steps` is decreased by 1, `index` is an even integer, `left` is 1, `right` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `steps` minus 1. If index < (right + left) / 2, then the sum of `right` and `left` is not equal to `2*index - 1`, and `index` is less than the average of `right` and `left`. If index is greater than or equal to (right + left) / 2, then `left` is set to (right + left) / 2 + 1, `right` is set to (right + left) / 2 + 1, the sum of `right` and `left` is not equal to `2*index - 1`, and `index` is greater than (right + left) / 2.***
