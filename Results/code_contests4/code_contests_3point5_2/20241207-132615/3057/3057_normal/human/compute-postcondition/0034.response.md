The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the value of the binomial coefficient "n choose k", where n and k are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the value of "n choose k" based on the constraints provided. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the value of "n choose k", where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 1.**
