Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` as input. It calculates the value of "n choose k" and prints the result. If the input `k` is odd, the function prints 1 immediately. If `k` is even, the function iteratively adjusts the `left` and `right` values to find the midpoint until it matches `index`. The output is the number of steps taken to find the value. Overall, the function calculates and prints the value of "n choose k" where `n` and `k` meet specific constraints.**
