Example Answer:
`index` is assigned the value `int(index)`, where `index` is converted to an integer. The value of `steps` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is an input integer based on user input, `index` is an integer value based on the input provided during runtime.
Output State: **`steps` is an input integer based on user input, `index` is an integer value based on the input provided during runtime**
