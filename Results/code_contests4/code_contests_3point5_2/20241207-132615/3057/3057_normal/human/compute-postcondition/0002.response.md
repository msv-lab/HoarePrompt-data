Example Answer: 
`steps` and `index` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`. Since the initial state is not provided, the values of `steps` and `index` after execution will depend on the input given during runtime. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` and `index` are assigned values based on the input provided during runtime.
Output State: **`steps` and `index` are assigned values based on the input provided during runtime**
