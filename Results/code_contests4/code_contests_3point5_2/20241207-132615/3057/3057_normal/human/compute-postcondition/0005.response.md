`left` is assigned the value 1. The value of `left` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` is an input integer based on user input, `index` is an integer value based on the input provided during runtime, `left` is 1.
Output State: **`steps` is an input integer based on user input, `index` is an integer value based on the input provided during runtime, `left` is 1**
