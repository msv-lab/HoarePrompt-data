Example Answer:
`left` and `right` are both assigned the value of `(right + left) / 2 + 1`. Since `left` and `right` are equal, they will both have the same value after this assignment. The condition `(right + left) / 2 != index` still holds true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `steps` needs to be decreased by 1, `index` is an even integer, `left` is the new calculated value, `right` is the new calculated value, and the condition `(right + left) / 2 != index` still holds true for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`steps` needs to be decreased by 1, `index` is an even integer, `left` is the new calculated value, `right` is the new calculated value, and the condition `(right + left) / 2 != index` still holds true for the loop to execute again**
