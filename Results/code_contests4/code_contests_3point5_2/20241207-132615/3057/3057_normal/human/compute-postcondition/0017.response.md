Postcondition: ***`steps` is decreased by 1, `index` is an even integer, `left` is `(right + left) / 2 + 1`, `right` is `(right + left) / 2 + 1`. The sum of `right` and `left` is not equal to `2*index - 1`. `index` is greater than or equal to `(right + left) / 2`. `index` is greater than `(right + left) / 2`.***
