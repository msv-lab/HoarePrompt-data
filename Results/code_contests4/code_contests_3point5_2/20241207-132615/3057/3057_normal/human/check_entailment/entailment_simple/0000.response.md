Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program reads the input values of `n` and `k` but does not generate the sequence as described in the problem. Instead, it performs some calculations involving `steps` and `index` and prints the final value of `steps` which is not the correct output.

The program should be modified to correctly generate the sequence as described in the problem and then find the value at the `k-th` position in the obtained sequence.
