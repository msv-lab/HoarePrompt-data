Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not fully follow the problem description. It does not handle the case where both cards have the same suit and the second card's rank is higher than the first card's rank, which is a valid scenario in the game of "Durak".
- The output hints also do not mention this specific case, so it is possible that the code is missing this edge case.
- Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
