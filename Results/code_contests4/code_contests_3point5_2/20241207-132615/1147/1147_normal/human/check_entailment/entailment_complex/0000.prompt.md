You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a card game called "Durak", which means "Fool" in Russian. The game is quite popular in the countries that used to form USSR. The problem does not state all the game's rules explicitly — you can find them later yourselves if you want.

To play durak you need a pack of 36 cards. Each card has a suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C") and a rank (in the increasing order "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"). At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. 

The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.

A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards’ ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat the second card with the first one.

You are given the trump suit and two different cards. Determine whether the first one beats the second one or not.

Input

The first line contains the tramp suit. It is "S", "H", "D" or "C".

The second line contains the description of the two different cards. Each card is described by one word consisting of two symbols. The first symbol stands for the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"), and the second one stands for the suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C").

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes) if the first cards beats the second one. Otherwise, print "NO" (also without the quotes).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a trump suit (one of "S", "H", "D" or "C") and two different cards described by two symbols each. The first symbol represents the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"), and the second symbol represents the suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C").**
def func():
    coz = raw_input()
    f, s = raw_input().split()
    d = {'6': 6, '7': 7, '8': 8, '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J': 11, 'Q': 12, 'K': 13,
    'A': 14}
    if (f[1] == coz and s[1] != coz) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (f[1] != coz and s[1] == coz) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            if (f[1] == s[1] and [f[0]] > d[s[0]]) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                print('NO')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input consists of a trump suit, two different cards described by two symbols each. `coz` is assigned the user input. `f` and `s` are assigned the input values after splitting. `d` is a dictionary mapping card ranks to their respective values. The second symbol of `f` is not the same as `coz` or the second symbol of `s` is not the same as `coz`. If the second symbol of `f` is equal to the second symbol of `s` and the rank value of `f` is greater than the rank value of `s` based on the dictionary `d`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input consists of a trump suit, two different cards described by two symbols each. `coz` is assigned the user input. `f` and `s` are assigned the input values after splitting. `d` is a dictionary mapping card ranks to their respective values. The second symbol of `f` is not the same as `coz` and the second symbol of `s` is the same as `coz`. If the second symbol of `f` is equal to the second symbol of `s` and the rank value of `f` is greater than the rank value of `s` based on the dictionary `d`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The input consists of a trump suit, two different cards described by two symbols each. `coz` is assigned the user input. `f` and `s` are assigned the input values after splitting. `d` is a dictionary mapping card ranks to their respective values. If the second symbol of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second symbol of `s` is not equal to `coz`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the second symbol of `f` is not the same as `coz` and the second symbol of `s` is the same as `coz`, the function checks if the second symbol of `f` is equal to the second symbol of `s` and the rank value of `f` is greater than the rank value of `s` based on the dictionary `d`, then 'YES' is returned. Otherwise, 'NO' is returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes user input for a trump suit and two cards, each described by two symbols representing rank and suit. It then compares the cards based on the trump suit and their ranks. If the second symbol of the first card matches the trump suit and the second symbol of the second card does not, it prints 'YES'. If the second symbol of the first card does not match the trump suit and the second symbol of the second card does, it prints 'NO'. If both cards have the same second symbol and the rank of the first card is greater than the rank of the second card, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not directly return any output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
