The trump suit is a string containing one of the values "S", "H", "D", or "C". The two different cards are described by two words, each consisting of two symbols. The first symbol represents the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", or "A"), and the second symbol represents the suit ("S", "H", "D", or "C").**
