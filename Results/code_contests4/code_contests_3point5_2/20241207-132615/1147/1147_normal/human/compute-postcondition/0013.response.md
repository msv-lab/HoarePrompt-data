Postcondition: ***The input consists of a trump suit, two different cards described by two symbols each. `coz` is assigned the user input. `f` and `s` are assigned the input values after splitting. `d` is a dictionary mapping card ranks to their respective values. The second symbol of `f` is not the same as `coz` or the second symbol of `s` is not the same as `coz`. If the second symbol of `f` is equal to the second symbol of `s` and the rank value of `f` is greater than the rank value of `s` based on the dictionary `d`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.***
