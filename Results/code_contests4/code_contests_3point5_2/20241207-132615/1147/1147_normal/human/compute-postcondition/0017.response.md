Functionality: **The function `func` takes user input for a trump suit and two cards, each described by two symbols representing rank and suit. It then compares the cards based on the trump suit and their ranks. If the second symbol of the first card matches the trump suit and the second symbol of the second card does not, it prints 'YES'. If the second symbol of the first card does not match the trump suit and the second symbol of the second card does, it prints 'NO'. If both cards have the same second symbol and the rank of the first card is greater than the rank of the second card, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not directly return any output.**
