Postcondition: ***The input consists of a trump suit, two different cards described by two symbols each. `coz` is assigned the user input. `f` and `s` are assigned the input values after splitting. `d` is a dictionary mapping card ranks to their respective values. If the second symbol of `f` is equal to `coz` and the second symbol of `s` is not equal to `coz`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the second symbol of `f` is not the same as `coz` and the second symbol of `s` is the same as `coz`, the function checks if the second symbol of `f` is equal to the second symbol of `s` and the rank value of `f` is greater than the rank value of `s` based on the dictionary `d`, then 'YES' is returned. Otherwise, 'NO' is returned.***
