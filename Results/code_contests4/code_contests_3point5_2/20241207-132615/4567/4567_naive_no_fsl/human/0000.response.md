Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program is determining whether it is possible to locate a right triangle with legs of length a and b on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. It then outputs the appropriate coordinates of the triangle vertices if such a location exists. The program calculates all Pythagorean triples within the given constraints and checks if there exists a triple such that a and b are divisible by the hypotenuse k. If such a triple exists, it outputs the coordinates of the triangle vertices.

The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines the possibility of locating the triangle as described in the problem statement. Since no case has been provided where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is True.
