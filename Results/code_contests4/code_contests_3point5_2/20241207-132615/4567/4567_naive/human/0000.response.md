Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem description. The logic in the program seems to be incorrect as it is trying to find all Pythagorean triples where the sum of squares of two numbers is equal to the square of a third number. This is not related to the problem description of locating a right triangle with legs of length a and b on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the given problem description.
