The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through the elements in `args`, writes each element to the specified `file` with the given separator `sep`, and finally writes the specified `end` character to the file. If the 'flush' key is True in the `kwargs`, it flushes the file. The function does not return any specific output.
