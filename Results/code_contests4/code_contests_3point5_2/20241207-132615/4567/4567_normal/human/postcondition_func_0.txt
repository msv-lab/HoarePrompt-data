The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It iterates through all possible Pythagorean triples within the range of 1 to 1000 for both `i` and `j`. For each valid triple, it checks if `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, the hypotenuse of the triple. If the condition is met, it performs a series of operations by calling `func_2` with specific arguments and then returns. If no valid triple is found, it simply returns 'NO'. There are potential cases where the code may not align with the annotations, especially regarding the exact values used in the Pythagorean triples and the corresponding actions taken.
