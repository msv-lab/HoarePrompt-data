Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code iterates through all possible Pythagorean triples within the range of 1 to 1000 for both `i` and `j`. For each valid triple, it checks if `a` and `b` are divisible by `k`, the hypotenuse of the triple. If the condition is met, it performs a series of operations as specified in the problem description and annotations. The code accounts for all possible cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
