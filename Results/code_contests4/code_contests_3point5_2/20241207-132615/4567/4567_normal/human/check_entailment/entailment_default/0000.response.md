# Initial Assessment:
The program seems to aim at determining whether it is possible to locate a right triangle with legs of length a and b on the plane in such a way that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes, and all the vertices must have integer coordinates. The program then outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on the existence of such a location, along with the appropriate coordinates of the triangle vertices if it exists.

# Code Review:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function generates Pythagorean triples within the range of 1 to 1000 for both `i` and `j`, checks if `a` and `b` are divisible by `k` (the hypotenuse of the triple), and then performs a series of operations accordingly.
2. `func_2`: This function handles input/output operations for the program.

# Output Hint Review:
The output hints do not provide additional clarity beyond what the problem description and the code itself already convey. They mainly focus on the input/output operations and handling of test cases.

# Edge Cases:
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as it iterates through a wide range of Pythagorean triples and checks the divisibility of `a` and `b` by the hypotenuse `k`.
- It ensures that the triangle is not parallel to the coordinate axes and all vertices have integer coordinates.

# Final Verdict:
The code appears to correctly address the problem description and cover all potential cases. It iterates through Pythagorean triples and checks divisibility conditions to determine if a valid location for the right triangle exists. The code also handles the output format as required.

Correctness: **True**
