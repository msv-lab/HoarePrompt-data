Correctness: **True**

The program uses a brute force approach to find Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition of having legs of length a and b such that none of its sides is parallel to the coordinate axes. It then checks if such Pythagorean triples exist where a and b are divisible by the same factor, and if so, it calculates the coordinates of the triangle vertices accordingly.

The program follows the problem description accurately by finding the Pythagorean triples with integer coordinates and determining if a suitable location for a triangle with legs a and b exists. The program outputs the correct result and coordinates as required by the problem description.
