Example Answer:
A new Pythagorean triple [3, 2, k] will be appended to the list trips if k is an integer. Here, i is 3, j is 2, and k is an integer, so the new Pythagorean triple will be [3, 2, k]. Therefore, the Output State is: trips is a list containing all Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition, i is 3, j is 2, k is an integer, and a new Pythagorean triple [3, 2, k] will be appended to the list trips.
Output State: **trips is a list containing all Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition, i is 3, j is 2, k is an integer, and a new Pythagorean triple [3, 2, k] will be appended to the list trips**
