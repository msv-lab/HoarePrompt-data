Postcondition: ***trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples, i is the first element of the first triple in trips, j is the second element of the first triple in trips, k is the third element of the first triple in trips, a and b are assigned values returned by the function get_list(). If a and b are divisible by k, then mul1 is the integer division of a by k, mul2 is the integer division of b by k, and (i * mul1) is equal to (mul2 * j)***
