According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the condition that `k` is an integer. If `j` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trips` is a list containing all Pythagorean triples with the newly appended triple [2, 1000, 1000], `i` is 2, `j` is 1000, `k` is 1000. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `k` should be checked to see if it's an integer.
State: **`trips` is a list containing all Pythagorean triples with the newly appended triple [2, 1000, 1000]. `i` is 2, `j` is 1001, `k` is 1000.**
