Example Answer:
A new Pythagorean triple [3, 2, k] will be appended to the list trips. Since k is the square root of 18 and an integer, k is 4. Therefore, after execution, the list trips will contain all Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition, including the newly appended triple [3, 2, 4].
Output State: **trips is a list containing all Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition, i is 3, j is 3, k is the square root of 18, k is an integer, and a new Pythagorean triple [3, 2, 4] is appended to the list trips**
