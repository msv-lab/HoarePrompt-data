According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` which is iterating from 1 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be considered. Therefore, the next value of `i` would be 3.
State: **`trips` is a list containing all Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition, `i` is 3, `j` is 1000, `k` is the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`, and `k` is an integer**.
