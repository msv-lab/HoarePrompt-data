Postcondition: ***trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple. i, j, k, a, b, mul1, and mul2 are updated accordingly for the next triple in trips. `mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`, and `mul2` is assigned the result of `b // k`. If a % k == 0 and b % k == 0, the function continues to update the variables for the next Pythagorean triple without returning any specific value.***
