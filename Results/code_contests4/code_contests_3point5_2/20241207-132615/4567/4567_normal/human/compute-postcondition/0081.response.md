Example Answer:
`mul2` is assigned the value of `b // k`. The values of `b` and `k` are affected by the previous Pythagorean triple in the list, which determines the value of `mul2`. Therefore, the Output State is: trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple. `i`, `j`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `mul1`, and `mul2` are updated accordingly for the next triple in trips. `mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`, and `mul2` is assigned the result of `b // k`.
