The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Within the function, there are multiple cases of output:

Case_1: The program returns the result of calling the function `func_2` with arguments (-i * mul2, j * mul2)

Case_2: The program does not return any specific value, but the variables i, j, k, a, b, mul1, and mul2 have been updated for the next Pythagorean triple

Case_3: The program does not return any specific value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to not accept any parameters, and depending on the case, either return the result of calling another function with specific arguments, update certain variables, or not return any specific value.
