According to the code, the loop can execute if trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples. Since we are iterating through trips, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the trips list. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **Output State: trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples, i is the first element of the first triple in trips, j is the second element of the first triple in trips, k is the third element of the first triple in trips, a and b are assigned values returned by the function get_list()**
