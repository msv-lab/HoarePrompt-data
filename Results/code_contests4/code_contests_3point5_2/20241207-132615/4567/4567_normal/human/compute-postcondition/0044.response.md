According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to 1000. At the end of the last iteration, `trips` is a list containing all Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is the square root of the sum of the squares of 3 and 1. Since `k` is an integer, a new Pythagorean triple [3, 1, k] was appended to the list `trips`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value within the range.
State: **`trips` is a list containing all Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is the square root of the sum of the squares of 3 and 2, `k` is an integer, and a new Pythagorean triple [3, 2, k] will be appended to the list `trips` if k is an integer.**
