According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 1001, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1001. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1001.
State: **`trips` is a list containing all Pythagorean triples with the newly appended triple [2, 1000, 1001]. `i` is 2, `j` is 1001, `k` is the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`, and `k` is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1001**
