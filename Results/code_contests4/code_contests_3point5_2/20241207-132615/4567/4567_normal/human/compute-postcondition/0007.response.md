Output State: **`a` and `b` remain unchanged. `sep` is either the value from 'kwargs' or ' '. `file` is either the value from 'kwargs' or 'sys.stdout'. `at_start` is True if the loop executes for the first time and False for subsequent times. `args` is not empty. `x` is the first element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, the `sep` value is written to the `file`.**
