Example Answer:
`mul2` is assigned the integer division of `b` by `k`. The values of `b` and `k` are assigned values returned by the function `get_list()`, which are divisible by `k`. Therefore, after execution, `mul2` is the integer division of `b` by `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples, i is the first element of the first triple in trips, j is the second element of the first triple in trips, k is the third element of the first triple in trips, a and b are assigned values returned by the function get_list(). a and b are divisible by k, mul1 is the integer division of a by k, mul2 is the integer division of b by k**.
