Example Answer:
`mul2` is assigned the value of `b` divided by `k`. The previous values of `b` and `k` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `mul2`. Therefore, the Output State is: trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple, i, j, k, a, b, mul1, and mul2 are updated accordingly for the next triple in trips; `mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`, and `mul2` is assigned the result of `b // k`.
