Output State: **trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples that satisfy the condition. All variables i, j, k, a, b, mul1, and mul2 are updated accordingly for each triple in trips. If a and b are divisible by k, the loop checks if i * mul1 is not equal to mul2 * j for each triple and takes appropriate actions as specified in the loop code.**
