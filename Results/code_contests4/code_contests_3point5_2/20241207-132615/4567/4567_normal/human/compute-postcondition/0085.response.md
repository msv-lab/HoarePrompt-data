Example Answer:
`mul2` is assigned the result of `b // k`, where `b` is the value of the previous triple's `b` and `k` is the value of the previous triple's `k`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `trips` is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple, `i`, `j`, `k`, `a`, `b` are updated for the next triple in `trips`, `mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`, and `mul2` is assigned the result of `b // k`.
Output State: **`trips` is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple, `i`, `j`, `k`, `a`, `b` are updated for the next triple in `trips`, `mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`, and `mul2` is assigned the result of `b // k`**
