Example Answer:
`mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`, `mul2` is assigned the result of `b // k`, and `func_2(j * mul1, i * mul1)` is executed for the current triple. Then, `func_2(-i * mul2, j * mul2)` is called with the updated values of `i` and `j`. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple, i, j, k, a, b, mul1, and mul2 are updated accordingly for the next triple, `func_2(j * mul1, i * mul1)` has been executed for the current triple, and `func_2(-i * mul2, j * mul2)` has been called.**
