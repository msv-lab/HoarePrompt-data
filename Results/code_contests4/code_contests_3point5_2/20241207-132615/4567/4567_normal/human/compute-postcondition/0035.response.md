Postcondition: ***`trips` is a list containing all Pythagorean triples with the newly appended triple [2, 1000, 1001], `i` is 2, `j` is 1001, `k` is the square root of the sum of the squares of `i` and `j`, and `k` is an integer. If `k` is an integer, then the list `trips` still contains all Pythagorean triples including [2, 1000, 1001].***
