Example Answer:
The value of `mul1` is updated by performing integer division of `a` by `k`. The previous values of `a` and `k` are known, so the new value of `mul1` can be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple, i, j, k, a, b, mul1, and mul2 are updated accordingly for the next triple in trips; `mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`.
Output State: **trips is a non-empty list of Pythagorean triples with at least one more triple, i, j, k, a, b, mul1, and mul2 are updated accordingly for the next triple in trips; `mul1` is updated based on the values of `a` and `k`**
