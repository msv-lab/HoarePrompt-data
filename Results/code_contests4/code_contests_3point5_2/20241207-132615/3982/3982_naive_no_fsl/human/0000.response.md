Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first reads the input values for the number of robbers, number of searchlights, coordinates of robbers, and coordinates of searchlights.
2. It then calculates the relative coordinates of each searchlight with respect to each robber.
3. It uses binary search to find the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration.
4. The program handles all potential cases by checking if a searchlight can see a robber based on the given conditions.
5. The logic and calculations in the program seem to align with the problem description, and it provides the correct output for the given examples.
6. Since no specific case has been provided where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.
