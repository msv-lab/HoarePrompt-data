Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration for the robbers based on their initial positions and the searchlight coordinates. The program iterates through all possible positions and calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the configuration safe. The binary search technique is used to efficiently find the minimum number of moves. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each input scenario described in the problem statement. Therefore, the code is correct.
