Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of robbers and searchlights, as well as their coordinates.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration by moving the robbers either to the right or up, based on the relative positions of the robbers and searchlights.
3. The binary search algorithm used in `func_1` efficiently finds the minimum number of moves required.
4. The program outputs the correct minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration for the given input examples.
5. The annotations and the code align with the problem description, and there are no edge cases or examples provided in the problem description that the code fails to handle.
