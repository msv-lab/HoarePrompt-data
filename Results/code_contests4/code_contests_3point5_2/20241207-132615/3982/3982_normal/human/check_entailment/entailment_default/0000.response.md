Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the searchlights are positioned such that they cover all the robbers simultaneously, making it impossible to reach a safe configuration. The binary search algorithm used in the code does not account for this scenario and may not provide the correct minimum number of moves needed to reach a safe configuration. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
