#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` retrieves values `n` and `m` from function calls, then calculates relative positions of lights with respect to robbers. It iterates over these positions to determine the availability of lights to cover certain areas. The function uses binary search to find the minimum number of lights needed to cover all areas and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 reads input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts the substrings into integers, and returns a list containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. The coordinates a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i ≤ 10^6.**

    #The program returns a list of integers where each element is the result of adding 'o' to the integer value obtained by converting each element 'x' after splitting the input string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `o`, splits the input string into integers, adds the value of `o` to each integer, and returns a list of these updated integer values. The code does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to input validation or handling non-integer inputs.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a function `f` and a list `dim`. It returns a list of values obtained by calling function `func_5` with arguments `f` and the unpacked values of `dim` starting from index 1. This process is repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, the program calls function `f` and returns its result. However, there seems to be a missing variable `dim` in the function signature, which could lead to an error.
