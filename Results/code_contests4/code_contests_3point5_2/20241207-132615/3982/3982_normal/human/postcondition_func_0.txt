The function `func_1` retrieves values `n` and `m` from function calls, then calculates relative positions of lights with respect to robbers. It iterates over these positions to determine the availability of lights to cover certain areas. The function uses binary search to find the minimum number of lights needed to cover all areas and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.
