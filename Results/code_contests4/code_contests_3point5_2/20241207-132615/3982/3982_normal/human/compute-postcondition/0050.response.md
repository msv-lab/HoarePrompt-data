Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `rel_lights_x`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, the next tuple in robbers should be considered, x and y are updated based on the difference between lx, rx, ly, and ry, both x and y are greater than or equal to 0, rel_lights_x will contain the appended value of x, rel_lights_y contains all the values of y that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of y.
