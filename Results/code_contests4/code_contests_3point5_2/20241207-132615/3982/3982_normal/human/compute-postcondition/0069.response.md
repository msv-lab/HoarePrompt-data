According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `l`, and `r`. If `i` is less than `ans + 1`, the loop can execute again. 
At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is not empty, `lights` is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_y` contains all values of `y` that are greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a value less than 1000001, `r` is 1000001, a list `avail` is created with zeros of length 10^6 + 1 + 1, `ans` is calculated as l + (r - l) // 2, `i` is 1, and `avail[i]` is assigned the value 0. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_y` contains all values of `y` that are greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute the third time `l` is a value less than 1000001, `r` is 1000001, a list `avail` is created with zeros of length 10^6 + 1 + 1, `ans` is calculated as l + (r - l) // 2, `i` is 2, `avail[i]` is assigned the value 0**.
