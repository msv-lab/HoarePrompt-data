ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing, `l` is 0, `r` is 1000001, a list `avail` is created with zeros of length 10^6 + 1 + 1
Code of the loop:
```
while l < r:
    ans = l + (r - l) // 2
    for i in range(ans + 1):
        avail[i] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        x = rel_lights_x[i]
        y = rel_lights_y[i]
        if x + y >= ans:
            sp = max(0, x - (x + y - ans))
            ep = min(ans, x)
            avail[sp] += 1
            if ep < ans:
                avail[ep + 1] -= 1
    psum_min = INF
    psum = 0
    for ax in avail:
        psum += ax
        psum_min = min(psum_min, psum)
    if psum_min == 0:
        r = ans
    else:
        l = ans + 1

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `n-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `n-1`, `sp` and `ep` values are calculated based on the last iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` for the last iteration, `psum_min` contains the minimum sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum` contains the total sum of all elements in `avail`. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, if `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *After all iterations of the loop, `psum` contains the total sum of all elements in the updated `avail` list, `psum_min` contains the minimum sum value computed during the loop execution, all other variables retain their initial values and relationships. If `psum_min` is 0, `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is not 0, `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`psum`, `psum_min`, `r`, `l` are integers. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. If `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans + 1` and `l` is also assigned the value of `ans + 1`.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
