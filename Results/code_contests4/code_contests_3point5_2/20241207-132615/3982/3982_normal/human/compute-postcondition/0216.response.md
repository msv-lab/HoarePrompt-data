According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `avail` list. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `ax` needs to be an element from the `avail` list.
2. `psum` should be updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
3. `psum_min` should retain its initial value of `INF`.
4. `r` should be assigned the value of `ans` if `psum_min` is 0.
5. `l` should be assigned the value of `ans + 1` if `psum_min` is not 0.

State: **`psum` is updated based on loop conditions, `psum_min` is INF, `r` is assigned the value of `ans` if `psum_min` is 0, `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1` if `psum_min` is not 0, `ax` is an element from the `avail` list for the loop to execute**
