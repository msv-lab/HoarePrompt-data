Example Answer:
The value of `x` is appended to the list `rel_lights_x`. The list `rel_lights_x` now contains the updated value of `x`. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` has been appended to the list `rel_lights_x`.
Output State: **`x` has been appended to the list `rel_lights_x`**
