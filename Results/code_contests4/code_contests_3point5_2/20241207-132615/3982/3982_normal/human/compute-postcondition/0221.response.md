Example Answer:
The `psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between the current `psum_min` and `psum`. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum` is updated based on loop conditions, `psum_min` is the updated minimum value, `r`, `l`, and `ax` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`psum` is updated based on loop conditions, `psum_min` is the updated minimum value, `r`, `l`, and `ax` remain unchanged**
