According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lights list. If the list has at least 1 light, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, robbers and lights are not empty, which means there is at least 1 light. In the loop, (lx, ly) represents the coordinates of a light. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, lx and ly should be the coordinates of the first light in the lights list.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2) and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time (lx, ly) is the coordinates of the first light in the lights list**
