According to the code, the loop iterates through tuples `(lx, ly)` in the list `lights`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `robbers` should be considered. Additionally, `x` and `y` need to be updated based on the difference between `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry`. Both `x` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, all possible values of `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, the next tuple in `robbers` should be considered, `x` and `y` are updated based on the difference between `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry`, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` will contain the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`.**
