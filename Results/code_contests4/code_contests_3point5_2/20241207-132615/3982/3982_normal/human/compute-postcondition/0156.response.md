Postcondition: ***The `avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is incremented to the next value, `x` is assigned the next value in `rel_lights_x`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y` at index `i`, `sp` is adjusted based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is assigned based on the new values of `ans` and `x`. If `x + y >= ans`, the element at index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1. If `ep < ans`, the element at index `sp` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `ep + 1` is decremented by 1.***
