According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `robbers` is not empty. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2), `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list**
