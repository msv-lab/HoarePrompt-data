According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `avail` list and the variable `ax`. If there are still elements left in the `avail` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `n-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `n-1`, `sp` and `ep` values are calculated based on the last iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` for the last iteration, `psum_min` is updated to the new minimum value, `psum` has increased by the value of `ax`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must still be elements in the `avail` list.
State: **`avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time**
