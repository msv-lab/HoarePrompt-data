Example Answer:
The value of `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. The previous values of `psum`, `ax`, and `psum_min` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `psum` is further incremented by the next `ax` value, `psum_min` is updated with the new minimum value.
Output State: **`avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `psum` is further incremented by the next `ax` value, `psum_min` is updated with the new minimum value**
