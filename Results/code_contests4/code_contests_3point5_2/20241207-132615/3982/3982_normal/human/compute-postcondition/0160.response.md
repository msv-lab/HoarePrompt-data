According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `avail` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, all elements in `avail` list have been updated based on the loop conditions. Additionally, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`. `sp` and `ep` have been adjusted according to the final values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`. The sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`. `psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF` and `psum` is assigned the value of 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `ax` is the first element in the updated `avail` list.
State: **All elements in `avail` list have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `sp` and `ep` have been adjusted, sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `psum_min` is INF, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ax` is the first element in the updated `avail` list**
