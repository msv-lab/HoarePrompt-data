Example Answer:
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The value of `ans` is unknown, the value of `x` is based on `rel_lights_x[i]`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]; `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.
Output State: **`x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]; `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`**
