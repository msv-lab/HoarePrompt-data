Output State: **All elements in `avail` list have been updated to 0, `i` is equal to `ans`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `ans-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `ans-1`, `sp` and `ep` values are recalculated, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `psum_min` contains the minimum sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum` contains the total sum of all elements in `avail`, if `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, if `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `l` should be less than `r`, `ans` is calculated as described.**
