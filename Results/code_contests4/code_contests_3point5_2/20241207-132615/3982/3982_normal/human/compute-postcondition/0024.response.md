According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `lights` list. The loop will continue until all elements in the `lights` list have been iterated through. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the `robbers` list needs to be considered. 
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop, next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time**
