Example Answer:
`rel_lights_y` is appended with the value of `y`, which was calculated based on the differences between `ly` and `ry`. The previous values of the variables are not mentioned, but since `lights` is not empty, there must have been some calculations before this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`, for the loop to execute again (lx, ly) are the coordinates of the next light in the lights list, `x` is the difference between lx and rx, `y` is the difference between ly and ry, and after entering the if statement `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` has been appended with the value of `x`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`, for the loop to execute again (lx, ly) are the coordinates of the next light in the lights list, `x` is the difference between lx and rx, `y` is the difference between ly and ry, and after entering the if statement `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` has been appended with the value of `x`**.
