Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, where `i` is 0. The value of `rel_lights_x` at index 0 is retrieved and assigned to `x`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `avail` have been assigned the value 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index 0.
Output State: **All elements in the list `avail` have been assigned the value 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index 0**
