Functionality: ** The function `func_5` accepts a function `f` and a list `dim`. It returns a list of values obtained by calling function `func_5` with arguments `f` and the unpacked values of `dim` starting from index 1. This process is repeated `dim[0]` times. If `dim` is empty, the program calls function `f` and returns its result. However, there seems to be a missing variable `dim` in the function signature, which could lead to an error. **
