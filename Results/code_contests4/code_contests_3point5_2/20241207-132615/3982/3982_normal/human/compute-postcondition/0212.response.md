Postcondition: ***`x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1, `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, the function modifies the availability of `avail` array by incrementing `avail[sp]` and decrementing `avail[ep + 1]`.***
