Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list. The value of `i` is not specified, so the value of `y` depends on the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list.
Output State: **`x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list**
