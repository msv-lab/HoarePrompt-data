Output State: **`psum` is the sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum_min` is the minimum sum of any consecutive subarray of `avail`, `r` is assigned the value of `ans` if the minimum sum is 0, `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1` if the minimum sum is not 0. The minimum sum is not equal to 0, hence `r` is assigned the value of `ans + 1, `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`**
