Example Answer:
`sp` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` are taken from the lists `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y`. The sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`. Therefore, the output state is `x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list. The sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is the result of the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **`x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list. The sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is the result of the calculation mentioned above**
