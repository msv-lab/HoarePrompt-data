Example Answer:
`psum_min` is updated to the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`. The new value of `psum_min` will depend on the previous values of `psum_min` and `psum`. Therefore, the Output State is: `avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `psum` is further incremented by the next `ax` value, `psum_min` is updated with the new minimum value.
Output State: **`avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `psum` is further incremented by the next `ax` value, `psum_min` is updated with the new minimum value**
