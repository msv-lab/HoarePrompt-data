Postcondition: ***All elements in `avail` list have been updated to 0. `i` is equal to `ans`. `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `ans`. `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `ans-1`. `sp` is recalculated as the maximum value between 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)`. `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The element at index `sp` in `avail` list is incremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, then `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. If the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, the described operations are performed.***
