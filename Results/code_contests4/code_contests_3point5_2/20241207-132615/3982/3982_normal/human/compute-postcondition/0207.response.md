Example Answer:
`sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` are known. Therefore, we can calculate the result of `sp` based on these values.
Output State: **`x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]; `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`**
