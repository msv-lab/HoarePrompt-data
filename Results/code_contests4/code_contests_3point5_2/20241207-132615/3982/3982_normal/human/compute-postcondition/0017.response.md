According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the lights list. If there are more lights in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `robbers`, `lights`, `rel_lights_x`, `rel_lights_y` remain the same. The coordinates of the last light processed are stored in `(lx, ly)`, and after entering the if statement, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `rel_lights_x` has been appended with the value of `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next light's coordinates should be retrieved from the lights list.
State: **`n`, `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty. `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty. `rel_lights_x` contains the value of `x`. `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`. For the loop to execute again, `(lx, ly)` are the coordinates of the next light in the lights list. After entering the if statement, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and `rel_lights_x` has been appended with the value of `x`.**
