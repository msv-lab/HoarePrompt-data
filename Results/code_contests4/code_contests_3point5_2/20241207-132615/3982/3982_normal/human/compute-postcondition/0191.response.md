Postcondition: ***`x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is the result of the calculation mentioned above plus 1, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list. Additionally, `ep` is less than `ans`.***
