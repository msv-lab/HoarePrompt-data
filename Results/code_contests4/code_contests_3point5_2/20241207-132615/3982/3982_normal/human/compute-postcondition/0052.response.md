Postcondition: ***n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. The next tuple in robbers is considered. x and y are updated based on the difference between lx, rx, ly, and ry. Both x and y are greater than or equal to 0. rel_lights_x will contain the appended value of x. rel_lights_y contains all the values of y that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of y. rel_lights_y contains the appended value of y.***
