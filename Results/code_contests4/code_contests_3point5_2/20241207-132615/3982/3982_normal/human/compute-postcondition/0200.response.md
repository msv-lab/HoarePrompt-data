Example Answer:
`avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. The value of `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)`, and the value of `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1**
