According to the code, the loop will execute again based on the lights list. After the previous iteration, the loop has processed a tuple (lx, ly) from the lights list. To execute the loop one more time, the next tuple in the lights list needs to be considered. 

State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. The next tuple in robbers is considered. x and y are updated based on the difference between lx, rx, ly, and ry. Both x and y are greater than or equal to 0. rel_lights_x will contain the appended value of x. rel_lights_y contains all the values of y that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of y. rel_lights_y contains the appended value of y.**
