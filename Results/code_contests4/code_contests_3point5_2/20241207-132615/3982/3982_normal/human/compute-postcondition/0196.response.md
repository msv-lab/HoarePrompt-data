Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, but the previous values of `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers after the assignment of `rel_lights_x[i]` to `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers after the assignment of `rel_lights_x[i]` to `x`**
