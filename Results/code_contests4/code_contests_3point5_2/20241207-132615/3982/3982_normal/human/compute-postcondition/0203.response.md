Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers. Initially, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is also decremented by 1. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, the function updates the availability of `sp` and `ep` accordingly.***
