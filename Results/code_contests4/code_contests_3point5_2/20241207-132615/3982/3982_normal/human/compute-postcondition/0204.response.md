According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep`, and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers. Initially, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is also decremented by 1. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, the function updates the availability of `sp` and `ep` accordingly.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `x + y` is less than `ans`, increment `x` or `y` to make `x + y` greater than or equal to `ans`.
- Update `sp` and `ep` based on the condition `if x + y >= ans`.

State: **`x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers. Initially, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1 and `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1. If `ep` is less than `ans`, `avail[ep + 1]` is also decremented by 1. If `x + y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, the function updates the availability of `sp` and `ep` accordingly, for the loop to execute one more time, adjust `x`, `y`, `sp`, `ep` based on the conditions stated above**.
