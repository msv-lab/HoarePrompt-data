Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the value `rel_lights_x[i]`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are unknown, and the values of `avail[sp]` and `avail[ep + 1]` are adjusted based on the conditions given. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions.
Output State: **`x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions**
