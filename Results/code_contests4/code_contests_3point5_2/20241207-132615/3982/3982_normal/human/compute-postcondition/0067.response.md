According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `ans + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing, `l` is a value less than 1000001, `r` is 1000001, `avail` is a list with zeros of length 10^6 + 1 + 1, `ans` is calculated as l + (r - l) // 2, `i` is 0, and `avail[i]` is assigned the value 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and adjust `ans` accordingly.

State: **`n` is the length of `rel_lights_x`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing, for the loop to execute the second time `l` is a value less than 1000001, `r` is 1000001, a list `avail` is created with zeros of length 10^6 + 1 + 1, `ans` is calculated as l + (r - l) // 2, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1, `avail[i]` is assigned the value 0**
