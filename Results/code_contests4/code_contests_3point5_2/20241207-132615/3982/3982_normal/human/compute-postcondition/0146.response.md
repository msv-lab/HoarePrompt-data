Postcondition: ***All elements in `avail` list have been updated, `i` is incremented to the next value, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is adjusted to `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and the elements in the `avail` list are updated according to the loop conditions to prepare for the next iteration. `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. `avail[ep + 1]` is decremented by 1 if `ep` is less than `ans`, otherwise there is no change in the `avail` list***.
