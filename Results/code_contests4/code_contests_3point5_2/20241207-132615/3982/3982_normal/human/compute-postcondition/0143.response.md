Example Answer:
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. The values of `ep`, `avail`, and other variables are not affected as per the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `avail` list have been updated, `i` is incremented to the next value, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is adjusted to `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and the elements in the `avail` list are updated according to the loop conditions to prepare for the next iteration.
Output State: **All elements in `avail` list have been updated, `i` is incremented to the next value, `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x[i]`, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`, `sp` is adjusted to `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, and the elements in the `avail` list are updated according to the loop conditions to prepare for the next iteration.**
