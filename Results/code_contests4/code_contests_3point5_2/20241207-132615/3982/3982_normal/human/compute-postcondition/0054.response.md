Example Answer:
The values of x and y are updated based on the differences between lx, rx, ly, and ry. The new values of x and y are lx - rx and ly - ry, respectively. Both x and y are greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are updated based on the differences between lx, rx, ly, and ry, where x and y are greater than or equal to 0.
Output State: **x and y are updated based on the differences between lx, rx, ly, and ry, where x and y are greater than or equal to 0**
