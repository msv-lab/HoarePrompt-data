According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the lights list. If there are more coordinates in the lights list, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`, for the loop to execute the first time (lx, ly) is the coordinates of the first light in the lights list, `x` is the difference between lx and rx, `y` is the difference between ly and ry, and after entering the if statement `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains the value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`, for the loop to execute again (lx, ly) are the coordinates of the next light in the lights list, `x` is the difference between lx and rx, `y` is the difference between ly and ry, and after entering the if statement `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0**
