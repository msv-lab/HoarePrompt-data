According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `ax` in the `avail` list needs to be the second element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` list elements were updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `sp` and `ep` were adjusted, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `psum_min` was updated to be the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`, and `psum` is the sum of `ax`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`ax` is the second element in the updated `avail` list**
