Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, the next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time, and `x` is added to `rel_lights_x` if `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.***
