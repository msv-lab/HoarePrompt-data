Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value `rel_lights_y[i]`, but the value of `rel_lights_y[i]` is unknown. The availability of `x` based on conditions may have been adjusted before this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]`.
Output State: **`x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]**
