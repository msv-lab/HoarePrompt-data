Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty. `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty. `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing. `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing.**
