Example Answer:
`psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `n-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `n-1`, `sp` and `ep` values are calculated based on the last iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` for the last iteration, `psum_min` is updated to the new minimum value, `psum` has increased by the value of `ax`.
