Example Answer:
`sp` is assigned the result of the expression `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`, which means `sp` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `x - (x + y - ans)`. 
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers, `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers, `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and `x`**
