According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `avail`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **All elements in the list `avail` have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `n-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `n-1`, the values of `sp` and `ep` are calculated based on the last iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` for the last iteration, `psum_min` is set to `INF`, `psum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time at least 1 element exists in the list `avail`**
