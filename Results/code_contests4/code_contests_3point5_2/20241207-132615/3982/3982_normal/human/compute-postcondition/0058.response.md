Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on the differences between `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry`, where `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0. If `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`, `x` is appended to the list `rel_lights_x` and `y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`. All possible values of `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop will be present in `rel_lights_x` and `rel_lights_y` after the loop has finished executing.**
