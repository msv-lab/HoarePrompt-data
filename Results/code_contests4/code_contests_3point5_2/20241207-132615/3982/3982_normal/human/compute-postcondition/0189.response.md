Example Answer:
`ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. Since the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, and `ans` is a specific value, we can directly calculate `ep` as the minimum value between `ans` and the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is the result of the calculation mentioned above, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list.
Output State: **`x` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list, `y` is the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_y` list, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is the result of the calculation mentioned above, `ep` is the minimum value between `ans` and the value at index `i` of the `rel_lights_x` list**
