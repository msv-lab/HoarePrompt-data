Example Answer:
`psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`. The previous value of `psum` and the value of `ax` are unknown, so the output state is: `avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`.
Output State: **`avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`**
