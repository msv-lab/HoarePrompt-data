Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `x` and `y` are calculated based on the difference between `lx` and `rx`, and `ly` and `ry.**
