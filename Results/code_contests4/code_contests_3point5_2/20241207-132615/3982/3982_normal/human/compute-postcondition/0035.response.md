According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `lights` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, and the next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in the `lights` list should be considered. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, the next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time.**
