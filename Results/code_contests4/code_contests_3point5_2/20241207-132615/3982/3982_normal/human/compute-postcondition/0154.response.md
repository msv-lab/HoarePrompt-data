Example Answer:
The element at index `ep + 1` in the `avail` list is decremented by 1. The value of `ep` is not given, so the specific element being affected cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: The element at index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1, and the element at index `ep + 1` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **The element at index `sp` in the `avail` list is incremented by 1, and the element at index `ep + 1` is decremented by 1**
