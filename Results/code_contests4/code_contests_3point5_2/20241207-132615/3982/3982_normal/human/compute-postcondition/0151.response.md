Example Answer:
`sp` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` are used in the calculation. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is incremented to the next value, `x` is assigned the next value in `rel_lights_x`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y` at index `i`, `sp` is adjusted based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is assigned based on the new values of `ans` and `x`, and the elements in the `avail` list are updated according to the loop conditions to prepare for the next iteration.
Output State: **`avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is incremented to the next value, `x` is assigned the next value in `rel_lights_x`, `y` is assigned the value from `rel_lights_y` at index `i`, `sp` is adjusted based on the new values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`, `ep` is assigned based on the new values of `ans` and `x`, and the elements in the `avail` list are updated according to the loop conditions to prepare for the next iteration.**
