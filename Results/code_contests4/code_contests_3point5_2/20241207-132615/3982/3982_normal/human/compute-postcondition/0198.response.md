Example Answer:
`sp` is assigned the value of the maximum between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` are known. Therefore, we can calculate the result of the expression and assign it to `sp`. 
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `ans`, `sp`, `ep` are integers, `sp` is assigned the result of the expression `max(0, x - (x + y - ans))`**
