According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `l` is less than `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to `r`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `l` should be less than `r`. All other states are already correctly set based on the last iteration.
State: **`avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `n-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `n-1`, `sp` and `ep` values are calculated based on the last iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` for the last iteration, `psum_min` contains the minimum sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum` contains the total sum of all elements in `avail`, if `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, if `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `l` should be less than `r`.**
