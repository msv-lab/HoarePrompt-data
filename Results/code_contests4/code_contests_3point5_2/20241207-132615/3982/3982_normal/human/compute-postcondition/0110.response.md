According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `avail` list. If the list still has elements, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `avail` list still has elements, `psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`, and `psum_min` is updated with the minimum value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `avail` list must still have elements, `psum` should be further incremented by the next `ax` value, and `psum_min` should be updated with the new minimum value.
State: **`avail` list still has elements for the loop to execute another time, `psum` is further incremented by the next `ax` value, `psum_min` is updated with the new minimum value**
