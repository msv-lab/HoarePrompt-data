According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `robbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `robbers` is not empty. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in the `robbers` list needs to be considered.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty. `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty. `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop. `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop. Next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time**.
