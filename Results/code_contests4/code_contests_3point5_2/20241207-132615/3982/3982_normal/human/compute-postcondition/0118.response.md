Postcondition: ***`avail` list elements have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `n-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `n-1`, `sp` and `ep` values are calculated based on the last iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` for the last iteration, `psum_min` contains the minimum sum of all elements in `avail`, `psum` contains the total sum of all elements in `avail`. If `psum_min` is equal to 0, then `r` is assigned the value of `ans`. Otherwise, if `psum_min` is not equal to 0, then `l` is assigned the value of `ans + 1`.***
