Example Answer:
`psum_min` is assigned the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`. The value of `psum` is updated based on loop conditions. `psum_min` is updated as the minimum value. The values of `r`, `l`, and `ax` remain unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `avail` needs to be considered. `psum` is increased by `ax`. Therefore, the Output State is: `psum` is updated based on loop conditions, `psum_min` is the updated minimum value, `r`, `l`, and `ax` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time the next element in `avail` needs to be considered, `psum` is increased by `ax`.
Output State: **`psum` is updated based on loop conditions, `psum_min` is the updated minimum value, `r`, `l`, and `ax` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time the next element in `avail` needs to be considered, `psum` is increased by `ax`**
