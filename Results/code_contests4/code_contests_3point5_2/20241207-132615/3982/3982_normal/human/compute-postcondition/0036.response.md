Example Answer: 
The values of `x` and `y` are calculated by subtracting `rx` from `lx` and `ry` from `ly` respectively. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not given in the initial state, so the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, the next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time.**
