According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ax` iterating over the elements in the list `avail`. If there are more elements in `avail` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `psum` is updated, `psum_min` is the updated minimum value, `r`, `l`, and `ax` remain unchanged. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `avail` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`psum` is updated based on loop conditions, `psum_min` is the updated minimum value, `r`, `l`, and `ax` are unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time the next element in `avail` needs to be considered**
