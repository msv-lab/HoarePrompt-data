According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ax` and the updated `avail` list. If there are more elements in the `avail` list, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the `avail` list have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `sp` and `ep` have been adjusted, sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`, `psum` is the sum of `ax` and for the loop to execute the first time `ax` is the first element in the updated `avail` list. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `avail` list and `ax` should be the next element in the updated `avail` list.
State: **All elements in `avail` list have been updated, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x[n-1]`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y[n-1]`, `sp` and `ep` have been adjusted, sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `psum_min` is updated to be the minimum value between `psum_min` and `psum`, `psum` is the sum of `ax` and for the loop to execute the second time `ax` is the second element in the updated `avail` list**
