Output State: All elements in the list `avail` remain unchanged except for index `sp` which has been incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index 1, `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y` at index 2, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans) + 1`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `ep` is less than `ans`, all elements in the list `avail` remain unchanged except for index `ep + 1` which has been decremented by 1, `x` is now assigned the value of `rel_lights_x` at index 1, and `sp` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and `x - (x + y - ans)`. `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. `x` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_x` at index 2.
