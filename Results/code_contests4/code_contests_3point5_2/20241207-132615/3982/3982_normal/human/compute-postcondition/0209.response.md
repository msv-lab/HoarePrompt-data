Example Answer:
The value of `sp` is calculated as the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, and `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`. Then, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]; `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`x` is assigned `rel_lights_x[i]`, adjustments made to availability based on conditions; `y` is assigned the value of `rel_lights_y[i]; `sp` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of the expression `x - (x + y - ans)`, `ep` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `x`, `avail[sp]` is incremented by 1**
