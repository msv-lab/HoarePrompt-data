Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000. `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty. `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty. `rel_lights_x` contains the value of `x` and has been appended with the value of `x`. `rel_lights_y` contains the appended value of `y`. For the loop to execute again, `(lx, ly)` are the coordinates of the next light in the lights list. After entering the if statement, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is greater than or equal to 0.**
