In order for the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `robbers` should be considered. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, all the possible values of `x` and `y` that are greater than or equal to 0 after the loop has finished executing, for the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `robbers` should be considered**.
