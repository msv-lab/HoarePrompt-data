Example Answer:
`psum_min` is assigned the value of `INF`, which is typically used to represent positive infinity in programming. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `avail` have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` holds the value of `rel_lights_x` at index `n-1`, `y` holds the value of `rel_lights_y` at index `n-1`, the values of `sp` and `ep` are calculated based on the last iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `ans` for the last iteration, `psum_min` is set to `INF`.
