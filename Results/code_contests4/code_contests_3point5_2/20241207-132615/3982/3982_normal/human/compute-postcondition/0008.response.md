Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2) and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` is an empty list, `rel_lights_y` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time (lx, ly) is the coordinates of the first light in the lights list, `x` is the difference between lx and rx, `y` is the difference between ly and ry. Additionally, after entering the if statement `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is greater than or equal to 0.***
