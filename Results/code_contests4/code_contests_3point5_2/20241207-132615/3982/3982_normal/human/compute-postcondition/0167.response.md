Example Answer:
`psum` is incremented by the value of `ax`, where `ax` is the second element in the updated `avail` list. The previous values of `psum` and `ax` are not provided, so the output state is: `ax` is the second element in the updated `avail` list, `psum` is incremented.
Output State: **`ax` is the second element in the updated `avail` list, `psum` is incremented**
