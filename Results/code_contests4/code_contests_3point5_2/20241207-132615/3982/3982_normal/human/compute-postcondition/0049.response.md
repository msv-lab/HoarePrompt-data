Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `lx - rx`, and `y` is assigned the value `ly - ry`. The values of `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry` are not given, so the values of `x` and `y` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, the next tuple in `robbers` should be considered, `x` and `y` are updated based on the difference between `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry`, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` will contain the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, the next tuple in `robbers` should be considered, `x` and `y` are updated based on the difference between `lx`, `rx`, `ly`, and `ry`, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0, `rel_lights_x` will contain the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`.**
