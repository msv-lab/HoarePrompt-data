According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lights list. If there are still elements in the lights list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the next element in the robbers list needs to be considered, and x and y are calculated based on the difference between lx, rx, ly, and ry. If x >= 0 and y >= 0, the program continues to iterate through the loop with the updated values. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the robbers list needs to be considered, and x and y need to satisfy the conditions.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000, `robbers` is the result of `func_4(n, 2)` and is not empty, `lights` is the result of `func_4(m, 2)` and is not empty, `rel_lights_x` contains all the values of `x` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `x`, `rel_lights_y` contains all the values of `y` that satisfy the conditions in the loop with the appended value of `y`, the next element in `robbers` list needs to be considered for the loop to execute one more time, `x` and `y` are calculated based on the difference between `lx` and `rx`, and `ly` and `ry. If `x` >= 0 and `y` >= 0, then the program continues to iterate through the loop with the updated values**.
