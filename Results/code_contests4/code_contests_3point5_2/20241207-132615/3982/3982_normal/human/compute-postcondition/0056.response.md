Example Answer:
`y` is appended to the list `rel_lights_y`, and `x` has been previously appended to the list `rel_lights_x`. Therefore, after execution, `rel_lights_x` contains `x` and `rel_lights_y` contains `y`.
Output State: **`x` has been appended to the list `rel_lights_x`, `y` has been appended to the list `rel_lights_y`**
