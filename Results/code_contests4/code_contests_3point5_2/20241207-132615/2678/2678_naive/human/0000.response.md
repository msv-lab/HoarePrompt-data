Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the given problem description. It starts by finding all the black squares and assigns them a distance of 0. Then, it iterates through the white squares adjacent to black squares, updating their distance values accordingly. This process continues until all squares are black. The program then returns the maximum distance value, which represents the number of operations performed. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
