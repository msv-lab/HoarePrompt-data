Correctness: False

The program provided does not correctly implement the described logic for finding the number of operations that will be performed. The code seems to be implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the maximum distance from a black square to a white square. This is not the same as the described operation of turning white squares black if they share a side with a black square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
