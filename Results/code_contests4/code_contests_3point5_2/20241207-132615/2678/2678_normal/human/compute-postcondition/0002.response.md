Example Answer:
`dist` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of H, which represents the number of rows in the grid. The previous values of `dist` are not relevant as it is being completely overwritten. Therefore, the Output State is: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; H is the number of rows in the grid, W is the number of columns in the grid; dist is a list of zeros with a length of H.
Output State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; H is the number of rows in the grid, W is the number of columns in the grid; dist is a list of zeros with a length of H**
