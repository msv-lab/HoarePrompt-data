Example Answer:
`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from this iteration. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` continues to be a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`, and `qq` contains all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned.
