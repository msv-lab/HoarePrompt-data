According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `H` is greater than 0. In this case, `H` represents the number of rows in the grid. Since the grid has at least one black square, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `dist` is a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, so for the loop to execute the first time, the `i` will be 0.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is the number of rows in the grid; `W` is the number of columns in the grid; `dist` is a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
