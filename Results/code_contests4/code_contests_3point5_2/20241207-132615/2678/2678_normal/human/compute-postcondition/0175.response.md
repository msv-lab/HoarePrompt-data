According to the code, the loop can execute if `q` contains at least one valid pair of coordinates. Additionally, `i` and `j` are valid values, and [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`. For the loop to execute, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`q` contains at least one valid pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, and `qq` is an empty list**
