According to the code, the loop will execute W times, where W is the width of the grid. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as W is greater than 0. 

Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `W`. Since `j` is already initialized to 0, it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, `W` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute `W` is greater than 0**
