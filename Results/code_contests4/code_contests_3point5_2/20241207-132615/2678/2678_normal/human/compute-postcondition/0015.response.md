Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. If the square at coordinates `[i, j]` in the grid is '#', then that square is updated to 0. The list `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to 0. The coordinates `[i, j]` are appended to the list `q`.***
