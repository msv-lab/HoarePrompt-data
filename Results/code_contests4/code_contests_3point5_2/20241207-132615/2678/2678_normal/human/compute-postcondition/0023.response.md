Postcondition: ***`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares. If the square at coordinates [i, j] is a black square ('#'), then it is changed to 0. `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and coordinates [i, j] are appended to the list `q`. If the square at coordinates [i, j] is a black square ('#'), it is changed to 0.***
