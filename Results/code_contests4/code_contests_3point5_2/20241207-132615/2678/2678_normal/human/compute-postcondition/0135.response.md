According to the code, the loop iterates over all pairs of coordinates in `q`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more pair of coordinates in `q` that have not been processed yet. 
At the end of the last iteration, all pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, you need to add a new pair of coordinates to `q` that have not been processed yet.
State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after processing all pairs, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances from the initial coordinates `i` and `j`, and a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q` that have not been processed yet**
