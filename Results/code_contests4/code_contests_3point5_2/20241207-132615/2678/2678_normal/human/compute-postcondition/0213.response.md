Postcondition: ***`q` contains at least four valid pairs of coordinates, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` contains all the valid pairs of coordinates after the loop has executed, `grid` has been updated with the new values assigned according to the conditions in the loop, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid` for the loop to execute. The pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfies the condition `0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W` and the value in the `grid` at that position is '.'***
