Postcondition: ***All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after processing all pairs, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances from the initial coordinates `i` and `j`, a new pair of coordinates that are one of [i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1] has been added to `q` that have not been processed yet. If 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and the value at coordinates `grid[r][c]` is '.', a new pair of coordinates [r, c] has been appended to `qq`.***
