According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates. Before the loop starts, the variables `i` and `j` are equal to `H` and `W` respectively. The variable `maxx` is 0 and `qq` is an empty list. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the list `q` must have at least one pair of coordinates, and for the first iteration of the loop, `(i, j)` should be the first pair of coordinates in `q`.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates, `i` is equal to H, `j` is equal to W, `maxx` is 0, `qq` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `(i, j)` is the first pair of coordinates in `q`**
