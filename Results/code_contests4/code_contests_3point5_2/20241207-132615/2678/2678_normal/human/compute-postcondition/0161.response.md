Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. A new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q` and appended to `qq`. `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates, `qq` contains the newly appended pair [r, c]. `i` and `j` are valid values. [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`. Additionally, 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W. The value of `grid[r][c]` is '.', and `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after comparing with `grid[r][c]`. `grid[r][c]` is updated to be `grid[i][j] + 1`.**
