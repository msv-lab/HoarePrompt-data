According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are still pairs of coordinates in the list `q`. At the end of the previous iteration, the grid remains a 2D list of characters, `dist` is a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated, `qq` contains the next pair of coordinates `[r, c]`, and `grid[r][c]` is updated.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, the grid remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0. The list `dist` continues to be a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. The list `q` still contains at least one pair of coordinates. The variables `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`. The variable `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. The list `qq` contains the next pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfying the conditions mentioned, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. The loop can execute one more time.**
