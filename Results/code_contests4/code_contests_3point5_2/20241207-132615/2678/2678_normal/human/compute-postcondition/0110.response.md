Output State: **`grid` is updated with the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with length `H`, `q` contains at least three pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the last pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from the last iteration, `qq` contains all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the loop, and the pair `[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq` after the if statement is executed.**
