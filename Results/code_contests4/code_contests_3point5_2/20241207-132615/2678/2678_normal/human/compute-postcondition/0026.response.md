According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `W`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1 and `j` is equal to W-1. To ensure the loop executes a second time, `i` needs to be less than `H`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` is 1, `j` is equal to W-1, and `i` must be less than `H`.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to W-1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `H`**
