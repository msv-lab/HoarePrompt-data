Example Answer:
`qq` appends the list `[r, c]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value, `qq` contains the list `[r, c]`.
Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value, `qq` contains the list `[r, c]`**
