According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are valid pairs of coordinates in `q` to process. Since the loop iterates over specific coordinates [i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1], the loop will execute if there are valid values for i and j. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, and [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`.
State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after comparing with `grid[r][c]`, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances where `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, a new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] has been appended to `qq` for each valid iteration of the loop, `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`.**
