According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `H`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `H` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `H` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is the number of rows in the grid, `W` is the number of columns in the grid; `dist` is a list of zeros with a length of H, `i` is 3, `H` is greater than or equal to 3, `dist[i]` is an empty list**
