Example Answer:
`qq` appends the list `[r, c]` to itself, which means the values of `r` and `c` are added to `qq`. The variable `maxx` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[i][j] + 1`, `qq` contains the appended list `[r, c]`.
Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[i][j] + 1`, `qq` contains the appended list `[r, c]`**
