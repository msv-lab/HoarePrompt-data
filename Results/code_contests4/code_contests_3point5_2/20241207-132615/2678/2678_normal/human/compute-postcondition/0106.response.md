Postcondition: ***`grid` remains a 2D list of characters with black squares updated to the maximum value, `dist` continues to be a list of empty lists with length `H`, `q` contains at least two pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the second to last pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from the last iteration, `qq` contains all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the loop and the pair `[r, c] is appended to the list `qq` after the if statement is executed.***
