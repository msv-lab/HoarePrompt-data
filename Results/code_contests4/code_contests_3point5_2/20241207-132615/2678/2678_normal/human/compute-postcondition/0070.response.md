Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the grid remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0. The list `dist` continues to be a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. The list `q` still contains at least one pair of coordinates. The variables `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`. The variable `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. The list `qq` contains the next pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfying the conditions mentioned, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`.***
