According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `r`, `c`, and `q`. If `q` contains at least 2 pairs of coordinates, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are the first pair of coordinates in `q`, `r` and `c` are within the boundaries of the grid, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `q` must contain at least 2 pairs of coordinates.
State: **For the loop to execute a second time, `q` contains at least 2 pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are the second pair of coordinates in `q`, `r` and `c` are within the boundaries of the grid, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`.**
