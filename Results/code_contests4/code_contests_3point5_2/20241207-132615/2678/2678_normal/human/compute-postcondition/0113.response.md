Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `grid` will be a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to the maximum possible value. `dist` will continue to be a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. `q` will contain all pairs of coordinates. `i` and `j` will be set to the last pair of coordinates in `q`. `maxx` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from all iterations. `qq` will contain all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned, where `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, `grid[r][c]` is '.', and `grid[r][c]` is updated to the maximum possible value within the loop.**
