Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `maxx` and the value at coordinates `grid[r][c]`. Since the value at `grid[r][c]` is '.', `maxx` remains unchanged. The other variables remain the same and the new pair of coordinates is added to `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` remains the same, `grid` has been updated, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`, `r` is within the height range `H`, `c` is within the width range `W`, and the value at coordinates `grid[r][c]` is '.'.
Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` remains the same, `grid` has been updated, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`, `r` is within the height range `H`, `c` is within the width range `W`, and the value at coordinates `grid[r][c]` is '.'**
