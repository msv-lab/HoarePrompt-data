Output State: `q` contains at least two valid pairs of coordinates, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` contains the updated valid pairs of coordinates, `grid` has been updated with `grid[r][c]` being assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` contains the new maximum value after the loop has executed, `i` and `j` are set to the initial values for the first pair of coordinates in `q` for the loop to execute. The pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfies the condition: 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'.
