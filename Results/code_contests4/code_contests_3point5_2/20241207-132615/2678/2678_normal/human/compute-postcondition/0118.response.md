According to the code, the loop can execute if `q` contains at least 1 pair of coordinates. At the start of the loop, `i` and `j` are used to initialize the values of `r` and `c`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `q` must contain at least 1 pair of coordinates, and `i` and `j` are the first pair of coordinates in `q`.
State: **for the loop to execute the first time q contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, i and j are the first pair of coordinates in q**
