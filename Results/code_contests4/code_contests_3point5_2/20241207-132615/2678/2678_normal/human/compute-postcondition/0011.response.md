According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `W`. Before the loop starts, the loop can execute if `W` is at least 1. The grid being a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square does not affect the loop execution directly. However, the `dist` list being a list of empty lists with a length of `H` implies that `H` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` being 0 is required for the loop to execute the first time. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `H` is greater than 0, `W` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0 for the first iteration.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is greater than 0; `W` is greater than 0; `dist` is a list of empty lists with a length of `H`; `i` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
