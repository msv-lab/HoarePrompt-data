Example Answer:
The variable `maxx` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`. Since the value in `grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` will be updated to the maximum between the previous `maxx` value and `grid[i][j] + 1`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same for the loop to execute a third time.
Output State: **`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[i][j] + 1`, other variables and conditions remain the same for the loop to execute a third time.**
