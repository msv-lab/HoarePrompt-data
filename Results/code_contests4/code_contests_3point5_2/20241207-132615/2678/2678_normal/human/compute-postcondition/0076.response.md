Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables will have the following values: `grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` continues to be a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the last pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from all iterations, `qq` contains all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned, where `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, `grid[r][c]` is '.', and `grid[r][c]` is updated to the maximum possible value within the loop.**
