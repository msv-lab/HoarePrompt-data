According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `i` and `j` are both 0, and the coordinates `[i, j]` are appended to the list `q`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, coordinates `[i, j]` are appended to the list `q`**
