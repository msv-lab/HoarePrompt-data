Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q`, `qq` contains the newly appended pair [r, c], `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after comparing with `grid[r][c]`.**
