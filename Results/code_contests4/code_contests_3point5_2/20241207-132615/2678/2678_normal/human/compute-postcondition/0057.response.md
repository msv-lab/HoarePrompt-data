According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid, so `q` is not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid, `i` is equal to H, `j` is equal to W, `maxx` is 0**
