Postcondition: ***`q` contains at least one valid pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` contains the appended pair of coordinates `[r, c]`, for the loop to execute a second time `[i - 1, j]` is a valid pair of coordinates in the list, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', `grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, and `qq` contains the list `[r, c] if the conditions are met. Moreover, for the loop to execute a third time, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[i][j] + 1`, and `qq` contains the appended list `[r, c]`.***
