According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and coordinates `[i, j]` are appended to the list `q`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, so `j` should be 2.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares. If the square at coordinates `[i, j]` is a black square ('#'), then it is changed to 0. `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and coordinates `[i, j]` are appended to the list `q`.**
