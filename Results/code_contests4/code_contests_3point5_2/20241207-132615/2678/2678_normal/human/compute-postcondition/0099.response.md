Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to the maximum possible value, `dist` is a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least two pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the second to last pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from the last iteration, `qq` contains all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the loop, `r` is within the range of 0 to `H`, `c` is within the range of 0 to `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', and `grid[r][c]` is updated to be equal to `grid[i][j] + 1`**
