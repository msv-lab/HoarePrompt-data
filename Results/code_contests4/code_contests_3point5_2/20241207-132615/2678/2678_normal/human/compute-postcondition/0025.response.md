According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `H`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `H` is the total number of rows in the grid. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should be less than `H`.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares. All black squares ('#') have been updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid, `i` is 1, and `j` is equal to W-1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `H`**
