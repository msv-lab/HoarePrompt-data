Example Answer:
The value of `grid[r][c]` is updated to be one greater than the value of `grid[i][j]`. The grid has been updated with the shortest path distances, so the new value of `grid[r][c]` is `grid[i][j] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] meeting the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` = '.' has been appended to `qq`, a new pair of coordinates in `q` is available and the conditions for the new pair of coordinates [r, c] are met, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`.
Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] meeting the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` = '.' has been appended to `qq`, a new pair of coordinates in `q` is available and the conditions for the new pair of coordinates [r, c] are met, `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`**
