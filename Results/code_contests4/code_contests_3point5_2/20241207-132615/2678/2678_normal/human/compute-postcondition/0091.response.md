Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. The previous values of `maxx`, `grid`, `r`, and `c` are not provided, so the output state is: `grid` is updated with `grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with `grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`.**
