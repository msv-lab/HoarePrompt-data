Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares and `grid[i][j]` updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid with the newly appended coordinates [i, j+1], `i` is 1, `j` is equal to W, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `H`, and if `grid[i][j]` is equal to '#', then it is updated to 0 as well, the coordinates [i, j] have been appended to `q`.**
