According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are pairs of coordinates in the list `q` that have not been processed yet. The loop iterates over the coordinates [i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the new pair of coordinates added to `q` must be one of these four coordinates. Additionally, `maxx`, `grid`, and `q` need to be updated accordingly. 
State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after processing all pairs, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances from the initial coordinates `i` and `j`, a new pair of coordinates that are one of [i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1] has been added to `q` that have not been processed yet**
