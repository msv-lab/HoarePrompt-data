Postcondition: ***`grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` continues to be a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from this iteration, `qq` contains all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned, where `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, `grid[r][c]` is '.', and `grid[r][c]` is updated to the maximum possible value within the loop, for the loop to execute `i` and `j` are set to the values in the list `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]. Additionally, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is '.'***
