According to the code, the loop will execute for each row in the grid, which is determined by the variable `H`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Additionally, since the loop iterates over the rows of the grid, the variable `j` which represents the column index should be reset to 0 for the next row iteration.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0**
