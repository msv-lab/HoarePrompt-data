Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after comparing with `grid[r][c]`, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances where `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, a new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] has been appended to `qq` for each valid iteration of the loop, `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'**
