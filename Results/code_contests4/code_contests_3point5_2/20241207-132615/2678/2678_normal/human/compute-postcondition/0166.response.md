Example Answer:
The value at coordinates [r, c] in the grid is updated to be the value at coordinates [i, j] in the grid plus 1. The grid has been updated with the shortest path distances between coordinates. The new pair of coordinates [r, c] has been added to `q`. Therefore, the Output State is: All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. A new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q` and appended to `qq`. `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates including the new pair [r, c].
Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. A new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q` and appended to `qq`. `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates including the new pair [r, c]**
