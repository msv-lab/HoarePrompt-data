Example Answer:
A new pair of coordinates [r, c] is appended to `qq`, which already contains processed pairs of coordinates. `q` contains all the valid pairs of coordinates, including the newly added pair [r, c]. `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value in `grid` at coordinates [r, c]. The previous state of variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. A new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q` and appended to `qq`; `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates including the new pair [r, c]; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value in `grid` at coordinates [r, c].
Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances.
