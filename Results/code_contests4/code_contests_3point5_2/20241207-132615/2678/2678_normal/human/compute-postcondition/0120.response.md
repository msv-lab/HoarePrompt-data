Example Answer:
The value at grid[r][c] is updated to be one more than the value at grid[i][j]. The values of r, c, i, and j are within the boundaries of the grid, and the value at grid[r][c] was '.' before the update. Therefore, the Output State is: for the loop to execute the first time q contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, i and j are the first pair of coordinates in q. r and c are within the boundaries of the grid (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W) and the value at grid[r][c] is one more than the value at grid[i][j].
Output State: **for the loop to execute the first time q contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, i and j are the first pair of coordinates in q. r and c are within the boundaries of the grid (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W) and the value at grid[r][c] is one more than the value at grid[i][j]**
