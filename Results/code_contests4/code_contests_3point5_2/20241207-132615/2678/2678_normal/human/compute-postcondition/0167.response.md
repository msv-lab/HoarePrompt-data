Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `maxx` and the value in `grid` at the coordinates [r, c]. Therefore, `maxx` will be the maximum between its current value and the shortest path distance at coordinates [r, c]. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. A new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q` and appended to `qq`. `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates including the new pair [r, c]; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value in `grid` at coordinates [r, c].**
