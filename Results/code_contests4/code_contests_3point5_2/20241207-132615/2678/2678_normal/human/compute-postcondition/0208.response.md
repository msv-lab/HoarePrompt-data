Example Answer:
`qq` is updated with the new pair `[r, c]`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` contains at least four valid pairs of coordinates, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` contains the updated valid pairs of coordinates with the new pair `[r, c]` added, `grid` has been updated with `grid[r][c]` being assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` contains the new maximum value after the loop has executed, `i` and `j` are set to the initial values for the third pair of coordinates in `q` for the loop to execute, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`q` contains at least four valid pairs of coordinates, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` contains the updated valid pairs of coordinates with the new pair `[r, c]` added, `grid` has been updated with `grid[r][c]` being assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` contains the new maximum value after the loop has executed, `i` and `j` are set to the initial values for the third pair of coordinates in `q` for the loop to execute, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`.**
