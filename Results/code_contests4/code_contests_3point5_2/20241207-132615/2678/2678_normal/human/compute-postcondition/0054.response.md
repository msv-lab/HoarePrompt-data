Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid with the appended [i, j] for all black squares in the grid, `i` remains 2, and `j` is equal to `W`. If grid[i][j] is '#', then the coordinates [i, j] are added to the list `q`.**
