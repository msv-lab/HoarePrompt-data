Example Answer:
The value in the cell [r][c] in the grid is updated to be the value of the cell [i][j] + 1. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly mentioned, so we cannot provide the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] meeting the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` = '.' has been appended to `qq`.
Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] meeting the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` = '.' has been appended to `qq`**
