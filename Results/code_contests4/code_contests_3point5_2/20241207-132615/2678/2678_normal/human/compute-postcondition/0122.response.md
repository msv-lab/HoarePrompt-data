Example Answer:
qq appends the pair [r, c] to itself. The values of r and c are within the grid boundaries, and grid[r][c] is one more than the value at grid[i][j]. `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and grid[r][c]. Therefore, the Output State is: for the loop to execute the first time q contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, i and j are the first pair of coordinates in q, r and c are within the boundaries of the grid, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and grid[r][c].
Output State: **for the loop to execute the first time q contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, i and j are the first pair of coordinates in q, r and c are within the boundaries of the grid, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and grid[r][c]**
