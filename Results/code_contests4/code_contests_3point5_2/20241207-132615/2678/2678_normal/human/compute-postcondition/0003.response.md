According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `H` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `H` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 1 and dist is a list of zeros with a length of H.
State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is the number of rows in the grid, `W` is the number of columns in the grid; `dist` is a list of zeros with a length of H, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `H` is greater than 0**
