Example Answer:
`grid[r][c]` is assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`. Since `i` and `j` are valid values, `grid[i][j]` is also a valid value. Therefore, after execution, `grid[r][c]` will be equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`q` contains at least one valid pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `[i + 1, j]` is a valid pair of coordinates in the list. Additionally, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'. After execution, `grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1.**
