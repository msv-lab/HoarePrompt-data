According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, q is updated to contain all pairs of coordinates from qq, so for the loop to execute the first time, `q` must contain at least 1 pair of coordinates and `i` and `j` are the first pair of coordinates in `q`.
State: **q is updated to contain all pairs of coordinates from qq, for the loop to execute the first time `q` contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are the first pair of coordinates in `q`**
