Example Answer:
`qq` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is reassigned the values of `qq`, all pairs of coordinates in `qq` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. All valid pairs of coordinates have been appended to `qq`. `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates. `i` and `j` are valid values. [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`. Additionally, 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W. The value of `grid[r][c]` is '.'. `qq` is an empty list.
