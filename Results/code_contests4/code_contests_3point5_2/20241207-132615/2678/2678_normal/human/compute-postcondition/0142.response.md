According to the code, the loop will execute for the next pair of coordinates [r, c] which are one of [i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]. At the end of the last iteration, all pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, and a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, a new pair of coordinates that have not been processed yet need to be added to `q`, and if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and the value at coordinates `grid[r][c]` is '.', a new pair of coordinates [r, c] should be appended to `qq`.
State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] meeting the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` = '.' has been appended to `qq`**
