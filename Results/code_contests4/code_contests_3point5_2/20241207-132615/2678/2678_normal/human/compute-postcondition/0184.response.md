Example Answer:
`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`, where `grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1. The value of `maxx` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value.
Output State: **`grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value**
