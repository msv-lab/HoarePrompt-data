Postcondition: ***`q` contains at least five valid pairs of coordinates. `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`. `qq` contains all the valid pairs of coordinates including `[r, c]` added through `qq.append([r, c])`. `grid` has been updated with the new values assigned according to the conditions in the loop. `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid` for the loop to execute and `maxx` has been updated to the maximum value.***
