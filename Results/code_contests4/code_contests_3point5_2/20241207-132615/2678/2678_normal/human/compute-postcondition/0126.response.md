Example Answer:
`maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. The previous value of `maxx` is unknown, but after execution, `maxx` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` contains at least 2 pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are the second pair of coordinates in `q`, `r` and `c` are within the boundaries of the grid, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **`q` contains at least 2 pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are the second pair of coordinates in `q`, `r` and `c` are within the boundaries of the grid, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`**
