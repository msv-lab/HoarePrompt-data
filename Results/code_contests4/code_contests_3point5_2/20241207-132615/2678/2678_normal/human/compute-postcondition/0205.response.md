According to the code, the loop can execute for each of the four pairs of coordinates in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `q` contains at least three valid pairs of coordinates, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` contains the updated valid pairs of coordinates with the new pair `[r, c]` added, `grid` has been updated, `maxx` contains the new maximum value, `i` and `j` are set to the initial values for the second pair of coordinates in `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, one of the pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` must satisfy the condition: 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'. `maxx` must be updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`.
State: **`q` contains at least four valid pairs of coordinates, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` contains the updated valid pairs of coordinates with the new pair `[r, c]` added, `grid` has been updated with `grid[r][c]` being assigned the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` contains the new maximum value after the loop has executed, `i` and `j` are set to the initial values for the third pair of coordinates in `q` for the loop to execute. The pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfies the condition: 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.'. `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and the value of `grid[r][c]`.**
