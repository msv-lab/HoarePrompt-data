Example Answer:
`maxx` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the value at grid[r][c]. The value at grid[r][c] is one more than the value at grid[i][j]. Therefore, if the value at grid[r][c] is greater than the current value of `maxx`, `maxx` will be updated to that value. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **for the loop to execute the first time q contains at least 1 pair of coordinates, i and j are the first pair of coordinates in q. r and c are within the boundaries of the grid (0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W) and the value at grid[r][c] is one more than the value at grid[i][j], `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and grid[r][c]**
