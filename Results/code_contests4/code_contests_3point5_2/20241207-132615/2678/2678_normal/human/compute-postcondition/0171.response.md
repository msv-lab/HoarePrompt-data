Output State: All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. All valid pairs of coordinates have been appended to `qq`. `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates. `i` and `j` are valid values. [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`. Additionally, 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W. The value of `grid[r][c]` is '.'. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `grid`, `maxx`, `qq`, `i`, `j`, `r`, and `c` will be updated according to the loop conditions and assignments. The state is fully updated with the shortest path distances and other relevant information.
