Example Answer:
The value of `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`. As all pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid. Therefore, the Output State is: All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] has been appended to `qq`, `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after comparing with `grid[r][c]`.
Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances, a new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q`, a new pair of coordinates [r, c] has been appended to `qq`, `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after comparing with `grid[r][c]`.**
