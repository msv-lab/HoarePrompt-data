Output State: `q` is empty, `grid` contains the shortest path distances for all valid coordinates, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `qq` is empty, `i` and `j` are valid values, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W, `grid[r][c]` is '.', all pairs of coordinates have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances, all valid pairs of coordinates have been appended to `qq` and `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates.
