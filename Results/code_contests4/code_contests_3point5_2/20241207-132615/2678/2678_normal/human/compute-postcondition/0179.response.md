Output State: **`q` contains at least one valid pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, `qq` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `[i + 1, j]` is a valid pair of coordinates in the list, `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, `grid[r][c]` is equal to '.', `grid[r][c]` is equal to the value of `grid[i][j]` incremented by 1, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `maxx` and `grid[r][c]`.**
