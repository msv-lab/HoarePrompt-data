Example Answer:
The pair of coordinates `[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates remaining, `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains the next pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfying the conditions mentioned, and `grid[r][c]` is updated to the value of `grid[i][j] + 1, and `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`.
Output State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates remaining, `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains the next pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfying the conditions mentioned, `grid[r][c]` is updated to the value of `grid[i][j] + 1, and `[r, c]` is appended to `qq`**
