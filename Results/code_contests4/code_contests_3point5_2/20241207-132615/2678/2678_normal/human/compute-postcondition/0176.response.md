According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list of coordinates `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]` is not empty. So, for the loop to execute, the list `q` must contain at least one valid pair of coordinates. In addition, the variables `i` and `j` are required to be valid values. Since the loop iterates over each pair of coordinates in the list, the loop will execute for each valid pair. 
State: **`q` contains at least one valid pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are valid values, [r, c] is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, and `qq` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `[i + 1, j]` is a valid pair of coordinates in the list**
