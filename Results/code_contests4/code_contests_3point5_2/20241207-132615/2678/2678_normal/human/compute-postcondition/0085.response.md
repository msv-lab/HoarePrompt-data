Output State: **`grid` remains a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0. `dist` continues to be a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. `q` contains at least one pair of coordinates. `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`. `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the maximum value of `grid[r][c]` from this iteration. `qq` contains all pairs of coordinates `[r, c]` that satisfy the conditions mentioned. For the loop to execute `i` and `j` are set to the values in the list `[[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]` and `r` is between 0 and `H`, `c` is between 0 and `W`, `grid[r][c]` is '.' and `qq` contains `[r, c]` if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.'), `grid` is updated with `grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1`. `grid` is updated with `grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1`.**
