Example Answer: 
The coordinates `[r, c]` are appended to the list `qq`. The values of `grid` and `maxx` remain unchanged as the code snippet only appends coordinates to the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `grid` is updated with `grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, and `[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`.
Output State: **`grid` is updated with `grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `[r, c]` is appended to the list `qq`**
