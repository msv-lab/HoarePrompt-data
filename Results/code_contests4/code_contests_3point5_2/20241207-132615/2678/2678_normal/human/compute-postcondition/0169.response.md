Postcondition: ***All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances. A new pair of coordinates meeting the conditions has been added to `q` and appended to `qq`; `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates including the new pair [r, c]. `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value in `grid` at coordinates [r, c] if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and (grid[r][c] == '.').***
