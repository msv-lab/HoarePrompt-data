According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to W. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than W. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares and `grid[i][j]` updated to 0. `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`. `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid with the newly appended coordinates [i, j+1]. `i` is 1, `j` is less than W**
