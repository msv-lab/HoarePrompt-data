Output State: **All pairs of coordinates in `q` have been processed, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the grid after comparing with `grid[r][c]`, `grid` has been updated with the shortest path distances where `grid[r][c]` is updated to `grid[i][j] + 1`, a new pair of coordinates has been added to `q` that meets the conditions 0 <= r < H, 0 <= c < W, and `grid[r][c]` = '.', a new pair of coordinates [r, c] has been appended to `qq` for each valid iteration of the loop.**
