According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `W`. If `j` is less than `W`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid with the newly appended [i, j], `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and if the square at position [i, j] in the grid is '#', it is updated to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid with the newly appended [i, j+1], `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and if the square at position [i, j+1] in the grid is '#', it is updated to 0**
