According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `H`. If `i` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `H` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dist[i]` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `H` must still be greater than 1 and `dist[i+1]` must be an empty list.
State: **grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is the number of rows in the grid, `W` is the number of columns in the grid; `dist` is a list of zeros with a length of H, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `H` is greater than 1, `dist[i+1]` is an empty list**
