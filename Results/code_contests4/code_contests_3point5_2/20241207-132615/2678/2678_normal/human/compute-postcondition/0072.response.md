Output State: **The grid is updated with the value of `grid[i][j] + 1`, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` still contains at least one pair of coordinates, `i` and `j` are set to the next pair of coordinates in `q`, `maxx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `grid[r][c]`, `qq` contains the next pair of coordinates `[r, c]` satisfying the conditions mentioned, and the loop can execute one more time.**
