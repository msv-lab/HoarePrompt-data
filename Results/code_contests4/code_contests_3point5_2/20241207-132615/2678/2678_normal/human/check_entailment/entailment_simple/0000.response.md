Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the grid, finds the black squares, and then iterates over their neighboring white squares to update them with the shortest path distances. This process continues until all squares are black. The program then returns the maximum value in the updated grid, which represents the number of operations performed.

The program handles the constraints provided in the problem description and ensures that every white square sharing a side with a black square becomes black, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
