Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the grid, marking the black squares with a distance of 0 and then calculates the shortest path distances from each black square to the empty squares. The program updates the grid with the shortest path distances and returns the maximum distance found.

The program follows the problem description as it ensures that every white square that shares a side with a black square becomes black. This is achieved by calculating the shortest path distances from the black squares to the white squares. The maximum number of operations performed is returned as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description in all cases.
