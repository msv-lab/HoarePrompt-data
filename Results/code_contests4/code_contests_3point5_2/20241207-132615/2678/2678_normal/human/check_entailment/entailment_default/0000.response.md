Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately follow the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the shortest path distances from each black square ('#') to the empty squares ('.'), which is not what the problem is asking for. The function should update the grid by changing white squares to black squares if they share a side with a black square. This different functionality makes the code incorrect.

Additionally, the output hints do not align with the actual code implementation. The hints describe a different functionality of calculating shortest path distances, which is not what the code is doing. This discrepancy further confirms that the code is incorrect based on the problem description.
