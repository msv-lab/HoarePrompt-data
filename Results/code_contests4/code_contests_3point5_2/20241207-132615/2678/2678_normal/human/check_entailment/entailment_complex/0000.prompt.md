You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns, where each square is painted white or black. HW characters from A_{11} to A_{HW} represent the colors of the squares. A_{ij} is `#` if the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is black, and A_{ij} is `.` if that square is white.

We will repeatedly perform the following operation until all the squares are black:

* Every white square that shares a side with a black square, becomes black.



Find the number of operations that will be performed. The initial grid has at least one black square.

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 1000
* A_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* The given grid has at least one black square.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
A_{11}A_{12}...A_{1W}
:
A_{H1}A_{H2}...A_{HW}


Output

Print the number of operations that will be performed.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: grid is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. Each character in the grid is either '#' or '.'.**
def func_1(grid):
    H, W = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    q = []
    dist = [0] * H
    for i in range(H):
        dist[i] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with at least one black square; `H` is the number of rows in the grid, `W` is the number of columns in the grid; `dist` is a list of empty lists with a length of H
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if grid[i][j] == '#':
                q.append([i, j])
                grid[i][j] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `grid` is a 2D list of characters representing a grid of squares with all black squares updated to 0, `dist` remains a list of empty lists with a length of `H`, `q` contains the coordinates of all black squares in the grid, `i` is equal to H, and `j` is equal to W.
    maxx = 0
    while q:
        qq = []
        
        for i, j in q:
            for r, c in [[i + 1, j], [i - 1, j], [i, j + 1], [i, j - 1]]:
                if 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W and grid[r][c] == '.':
                    grid[r][c] = grid[i][j] + 1
                    maxx = max(maxx, grid[r][c])
                    qq.append([r, c])
        
        q = qq
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `q` is empty, `grid` contains the shortest path distances for all valid coordinates, `maxx` contains the maximum value in the updated `grid`, `qq` is empty, `i` and `j` are valid values, `[r, c]` is a valid pair of coordinates in `q`, 0 <= r < H and 0 <= c < W, `grid[r][c]` is '.', all pairs of coordinates have been processed and updated in `grid` with the shortest path distances, all valid pairs of coordinates have been appended to `qq` and `q` contains valid pairs of coordinates.
    return maxx
    #The program returns the maximum value in the updated grid
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `grid` representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. It updates the grid by calculating the shortest path distances from each black square ('#') to the empty squares ('.'). It then returns the maximum shortest path distance found in the updated grid.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
