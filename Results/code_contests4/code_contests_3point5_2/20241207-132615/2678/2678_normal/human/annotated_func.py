#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `grid` representing a grid of squares with at least one black square. It updates the grid by calculating the shortest path distances from each black square ('#') to the empty squares ('.'). It then returns the maximum shortest path distance found in the updated grid.
