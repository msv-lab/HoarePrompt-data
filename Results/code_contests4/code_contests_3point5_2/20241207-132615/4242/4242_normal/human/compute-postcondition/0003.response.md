According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `res` is initialized to a very large number, so it does not affect the loop execution. For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element, and `c` should be the first permutation of `a`.
State: **`res` is initialized to a very large number, `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, for the loop to execute the first time `a` has at least one element, `c` is the first permutation of `a`**
