Example Answer:
The expression calculates a value using the variables `res`, `c`, and `z`. The `eval()` function evaluates the string as a Python expression. The result of the expression is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `res` and the calculated value. The previous values of `res`, `c`, and `z` are unknown, so the output state is: `res` is updated to the minimum value calculated by the expression.
Output State: **`res` is updated to the minimum value calculated by the expression**
