The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on four integer variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, where 0 <= a, b, c, d <= 1000. The function performs a sequence of three operations, each being either addition '+' or multiplication '*'. The function then returns the final result of these operations on the four variables. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates on four integer variables a, b, c, d with values between 0 and 1000, performs a sequence of three operations (either addition or multiplication), and returns the final result of these operations on the variables.**
