Example Answer:
`z` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts an input and splits it based on whitespace. The previous value of `res` is a very large number, and `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is initialized to a very large number, `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`.
Output State: **`res` is initialized to a very large number, `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`**
