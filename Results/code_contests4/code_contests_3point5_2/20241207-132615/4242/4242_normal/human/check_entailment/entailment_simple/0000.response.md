Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by iterating through all permutations of the original numbers and the operations, calculating the result of each possible arrangement, and updating the minimum result found so far. The program then prints the minimum result obtained.

The use of `eval` to evaluate the mathematical expressions ensures that the program accurately calculates the result based on the sequence of operations provided. The program considers all possible combinations of operations on the original numbers as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and will provide the correct minimal result for any given input.
