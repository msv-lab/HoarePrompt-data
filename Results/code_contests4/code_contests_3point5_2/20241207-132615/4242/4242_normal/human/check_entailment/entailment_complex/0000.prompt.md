You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently, Vladimir got bad mark in algebra again. To avoid such unpleasant events in future he decided to train his arithmetic skills. He wrote four integer numbers a, b, c, d on the blackboard. During each of the next three minutes he took two numbers from the blackboard (not necessarily adjacent) and replaced them with their sum or their product. In the end he got one number. Unfortunately, due to the awful memory he forgot that number, but he remembers four original numbers, sequence of the operations and his surprise because of the very small result. Help Vladimir remember the forgotten number: find the smallest number that can be obtained from the original numbers by the given sequence of operations.

Input

First line contains four integers separated by space: 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000 — the original numbers. Second line contains three signs ('+' or '*' each) separated by space — the sequence of the operations in the order of performing. ('+' stands for addition, '*' — multiplication)

Output

Output one integer number — the minimal result which can be obtained.

Please, do not use %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use cin (also you may use %I64d).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d <= 1000. The sequence of operations consists of three characters, each being either '+' or '*'.**
def func():
    res = 100000000000000000000000000
    a = raw_input().split()
    z = raw_input().split()
    for c in itertools.permutations(a):
        res = min(res, eval('((' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[1] + c[2] + ')' + z
            [2] + c[3]))
        
        res = min(res, eval('(' + c[0] + z[0] + c[1] + ')' + z[2] + '(' + c[2] + z[
            1] + c[3] + ')'))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is updated to the minimum value calculated by the expression after all iterations of the loop have finished. The values of `c` and `z` may have been updated based on the calculations within the loop.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input for four integer variables a, b, c, d with values between 0 and 1000. Then, it generates permutations of the values of a and performs calculations based on the sequence of operations specified by the input z. It finds the minimum result obtained from different combinations of operations on a and prints this minimum result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
