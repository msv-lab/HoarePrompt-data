Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It reads input for four integer variables a, b, c, d within the specified range of 0 to 1000. It then generates permutations of these values and performs calculations based on the sequence of operations specified by the input. It finds the minimum result obtained from different combinations of operations and prints this minimum result. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the smallest number that can be obtained from the original numbers by the given sequence of operations.
