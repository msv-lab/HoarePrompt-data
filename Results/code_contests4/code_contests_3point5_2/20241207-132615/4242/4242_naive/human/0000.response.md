Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case when the input numbers are negative. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the numbers a, b, c, d can range from 0 to 1000, but the code does not have any check for negative numbers. If negative numbers are provided as input, the program may not give the correct output. 

For example, if the input is:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1
* * +
```
The expected output should be -1, as the product of negative numbers is negative and adding them will result in a more negative number. However, the code does not account for negative numbers and may produce a different output.
