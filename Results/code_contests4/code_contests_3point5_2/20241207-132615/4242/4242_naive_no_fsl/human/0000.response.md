Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes four integers as input (a, b, c, d) and three signs representing the operations to be performed. It then calculates all permutations of the input numbers and evaluates the expressions based on the given operations to find the minimal result.

The program logic correctly follows the problem description by considering all possible permutations of the input numbers and performing the operations in the specified order. The program uses the eval function to evaluate the expressions and find the minimal result.

Since the program covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately, I believe it is correct in all scenarios.
