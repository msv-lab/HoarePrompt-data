Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided annotated program does not perform any calculations or operations related to the problem description. It simply initializes a string `s` with a sequence of numbers, splits it into a list of integers `a`, and does not return any value. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not calculate the number of excellent numbers of length exactly `n` as required.
