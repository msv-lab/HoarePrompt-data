Correctness: **False**

The given code `print(5)` does not align with the problem description. The problem description asks to calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array. However, the code simply prints the number 5 without performing any calculations based on the input array a and the required number of equal elements k. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not address the problem description at all.
