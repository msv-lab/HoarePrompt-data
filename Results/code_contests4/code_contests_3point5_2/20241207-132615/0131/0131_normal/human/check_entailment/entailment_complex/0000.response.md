Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not match the problem description at all. The program does not calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain at least k equal elements in the array as required by the problem description. Instead, it just prints the number 5 to the console without any relevance to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
