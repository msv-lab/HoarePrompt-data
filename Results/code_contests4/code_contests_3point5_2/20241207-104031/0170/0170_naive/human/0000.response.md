Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads the input correctly and for each test case, it constructs a sequence `p` based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The sequence `p` is constructed in such a way that no two adjacent elements are equal and each element is chosen from the set {a_i, b_i, c_i}. The program follows the requirements specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for all test cases.
