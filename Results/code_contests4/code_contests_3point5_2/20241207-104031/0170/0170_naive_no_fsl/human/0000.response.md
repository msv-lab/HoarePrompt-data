Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for multiple test cases and for each test case, it follows the given problem description to find a proper sequence that satisfies all the conditions. It iterates through the elements of the sequences a, b, and c, and assigns values to the elements of the resulting sequence p such that adjacent elements are not equal. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the conditions mentioned in the problem description are met. 

Since the program follows the problem description for all test cases and provides the correct output as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
