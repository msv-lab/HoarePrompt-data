Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is an array with `n` elements, where `ans[0]` is the value of `a[0]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.**
