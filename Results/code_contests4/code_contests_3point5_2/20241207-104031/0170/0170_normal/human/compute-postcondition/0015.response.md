Example Answer:
`sep` is written to `file`. Since `sep` is a space, a space will be written to the file. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` now contains a space, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` now contains a space, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list**
