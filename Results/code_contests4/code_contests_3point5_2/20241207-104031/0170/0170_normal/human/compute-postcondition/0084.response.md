Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of `n` elements with updated values based on the conditions in the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the updated return values of `func_5()`, and the loop executes based on the conditions specified in `func_1()`. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then the loop continues its execution. Otherwise, if `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then the loop continues. If neither condition is met, the overall state of the program remains the same.***
