Example Answer:
`str(x)` is written to `file`. The value of `x` is the next element in the list, so `x` is written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', a space is written to `file`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', a space is written to `file`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list**
