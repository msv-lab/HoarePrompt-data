Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of `n` elements with updated values based on the conditions in the code. If `ans[i - 1] != b[i]`, then `ans` remains the same with `a`, `b`, and `c` being the updated return values of `func_5()` and the loop executing based on the conditions specified in `func_1()`. If `ans[i - 1] == b[i]`, then each element `i` in `ans` is assigned the value of `c[i]`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the loop executes based on the conditions specified in `func_1()`.***
