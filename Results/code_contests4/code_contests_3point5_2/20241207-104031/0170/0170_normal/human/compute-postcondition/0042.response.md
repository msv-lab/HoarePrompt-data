Postcondition: ***`n` is the return value of `func_1`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans` is an array with `n` elements, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, ans[i - 1] is equal to a[i]. Moreover, after entering the if condition, the value of ans[i - 1] is not equal to b[i]***
