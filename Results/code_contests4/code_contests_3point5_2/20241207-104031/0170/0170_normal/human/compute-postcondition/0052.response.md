Postcondition: ***`n`, `c` are the return values of `func_1` and `func_5` respectively. `ans` is an array with `n` elements. Initially, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5`. `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `ans[i - 1] != b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to the value of `b[i]`. If `ans[i - 1] == b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is updated to the value of `c[i]`.***
