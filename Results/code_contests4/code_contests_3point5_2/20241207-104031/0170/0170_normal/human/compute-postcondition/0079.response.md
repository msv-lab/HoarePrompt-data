According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ans`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the return values of `func_1()` and `func_5()`. 
At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the return values of `func_5()`, and `func_1()` determines if the loop will execute one more time. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` will be assigned the value of `a[i]`.
- If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]` and `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` will be assigned the value of `c[i]`.

Therefore, in the next iteration of the loop:
State: **`ans` is a list of `n` elements with updated values based on the conditions in the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the updated return values of `func_5()`, and the loop executes based on the conditions specified in `func_1()`**.
