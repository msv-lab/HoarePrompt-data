Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the return value of `func_1()`. The conditions for the loop to execute again are not specified, so it is unknown how the loop will progress. The value of `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`. The array `ans` with `n` elements is mentioned but its values are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, and `ans` is an array with `n` elements, where the values are not specified.
Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_1()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, and `ans` is an array with `n` elements, where the values are not specified.**
