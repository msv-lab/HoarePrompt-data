Postcondition: ***`n`, `c` are the return values of `func_1` and `func_5` respectively. `ans` is an array with `n` elements. Initially, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5`. `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. After the execution of the if-else block, either `ans[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `b[i]` if the condition is true, or `ans[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `c[i]` if the condition is false.***
