Output State: `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `a` is the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`. If the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time. `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`.
