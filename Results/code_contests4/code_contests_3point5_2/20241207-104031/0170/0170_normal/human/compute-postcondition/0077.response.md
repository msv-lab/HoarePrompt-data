Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `a` is the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, if the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, the condition (ans[i - 1] != a[i]) is false, and after executing the if part, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. If the else part is executed, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `a` is the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, if the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, the condition (ans[i - 1] != a[i]) is false, and the condition (ans[i - 1] == b[i]) is true, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.***
