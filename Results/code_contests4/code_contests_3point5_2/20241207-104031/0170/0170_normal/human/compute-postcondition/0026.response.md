Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`, where `i` is 3. The previous values of `ans` and `c` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is initialized with `n` number of elements, each set to 0, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 3, and `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is initialized with `n` number of elements, each set to 0, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 3, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`**
