Example Answer:
The function `func_20` is called with the parameters `*ans`, which means the function will operate on the elements of the list `ans`. The final values of `ans` will be updated based on the conditions specified within the function. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged. The specific calculations depend on the implementation of the function and the relationships between `ans[i-1]`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` for each iteration. 
Output State: **The final values of `ans` will be updated based on the conditions specified within the function. Values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain the same as they were initially assigned.**
