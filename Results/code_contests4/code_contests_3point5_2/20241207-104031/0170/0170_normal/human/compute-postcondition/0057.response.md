Example Answer:
The value of `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`. The value of `c` is updated based on the conditions `ans[i - 1] != a[i]` and `ans[i - 1] == a[i]` for the next iteration, but the exact values of `c` and `a` are not given. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i] based on certain conditions.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i] based on certain conditions**
