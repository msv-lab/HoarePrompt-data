According to the code, the loop can execute based on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is an array with `n` elements, where `ans[0]` is the value of `a[0]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. Update the return value of `func_1()` to determine if the loop will execute again.
2. Update `ans` based on the conditions specified in the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `ans` is an array with `n` elements, where the values are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for the next iteration, for the loop to execute again the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0**
