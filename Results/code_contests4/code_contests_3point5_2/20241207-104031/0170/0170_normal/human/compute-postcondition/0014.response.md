According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements left in the `args` list. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is ' ', a space is written to `file`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list. So for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have elements remaining and `x` will be the next element in the list after the previous iteration.

State: **`sep` is ' ', a space is written to `file`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list, for the loop to execute one more time `args` must still have elements remaining and `x` will be the next element in the list**
