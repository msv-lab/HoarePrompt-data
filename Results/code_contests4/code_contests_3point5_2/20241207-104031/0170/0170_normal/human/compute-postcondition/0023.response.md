Postcondition: ***`sep` is ' ', `file` contains all the elements in `args` separated by a space, `at_start` is False, `args` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the list, the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is written to the file, and if `flush` is True, then the program executes the statements inside the if block, otherwise no changes occur.***
