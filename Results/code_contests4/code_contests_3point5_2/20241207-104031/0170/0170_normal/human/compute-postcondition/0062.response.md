According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the final values of `ans` will be updated based on the conditions specified within the function. Values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain the same as they were initially assigned. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
