According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` is an array with `n` elements does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is the return value of `func_1`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans` is an array with `n` elements, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
