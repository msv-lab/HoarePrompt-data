Example Answer:
`ans[i]` is assigned the value `b[i]`. The values of `n` and `c` are not affected directly by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is updated based on the conditions `ans[i - 1] != a[i]` and `ans[i - 1] == a[i]` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is updated based on the conditions `ans[i - 1] != a[i]` and `ans[i - 1] == a[i]` for the next iteration**
