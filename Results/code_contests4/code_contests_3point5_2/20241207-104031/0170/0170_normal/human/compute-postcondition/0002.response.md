Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. Since `at_start` is initially `True`, after execution, `at_start` remains `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is True**
