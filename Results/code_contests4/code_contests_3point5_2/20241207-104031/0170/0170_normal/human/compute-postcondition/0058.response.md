Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3. In the if part, `c` is updated based on the conditions `ans[i - 1] != a[i]` and `ans[i - 1] == a[i]` for the next iteration. In the else part, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i] based on certain conditions.***
