According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `c` are the return values of `func_1` and `func_5` respectively. Initially, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5`. `ans` is an array with `n` elements where `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `c` are the return values of `func_1` and `func_5` respectively. `ans` is an array with `n` elements. Initially, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the return value of `func_5`. `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
