Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the `file` using the `write` method. Since `sep` is ' ', a space is written to the output. The value of `at_start` remains False. The loop may execute one more time as `args` has at least 2 elements, and `x` is the next element in the list.
Output State: **`sep` is ' ', `file` has a space written to it, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list**
