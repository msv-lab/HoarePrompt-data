Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the return values of `func_5()`, and `func_1()` determines if the loop will execute one more time. If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. If `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `a[i]` and `ans[i - 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `c[i]`.***
