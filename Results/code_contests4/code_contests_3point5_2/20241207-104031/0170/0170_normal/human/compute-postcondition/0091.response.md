Output State: **`ans` is a list of `n` elements with updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the final return values of `func_5()`, and the loop executes based on the conditions specified in `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0, the loop will execute till `i = n-1`. The final values of `ans` will depend on the comparisons between `ans[i-1]`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]` for each iteration.**
