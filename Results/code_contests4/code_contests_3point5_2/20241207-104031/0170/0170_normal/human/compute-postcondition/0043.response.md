Example Answer:
The value of `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`. The values of `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the return values of `func_1` and `func_5` respectively. The value of `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. Since `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop executes. After entering the if condition, the value of `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the return value of `func_1`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans` is an array with `n` elements, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, ans[i - 1] is equal to a[i], and after entering the if condition, the value of ans[i - 1] is not equal to b[i].
Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_1`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans` is an array with `n` elements, `a` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5`, `c` is the return value of `func_5`, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, ans[i - 1] is equal to a[i], and after entering the if condition, the value of ans[i - 1] is not equal to b[i]**
