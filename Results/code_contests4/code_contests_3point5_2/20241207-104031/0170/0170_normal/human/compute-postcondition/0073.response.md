Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `a` is the return value of `func_5()`, `b` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, `c` is assigned the return value of `func_5()`, the return value of `func_1()` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time, `ans[0]` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, and the condition (ans[i - 1] != a[i]) is false. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the condition (ans[i - 1] != b[i]) is also true.***
