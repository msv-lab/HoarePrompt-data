Based on the conditions specified in the code:
- If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the loop continues.
- If `ans[i - 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues.
- If neither condition is met, the overall state of the program remains the same.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`ans` is a list of `n` elements with updated values based on the conditions in the code, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the updated return values of `func_5()`, and the loop executes based on the conditions specified in `func_1()`.**
