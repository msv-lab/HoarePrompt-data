The function generates a list of tuples, each tuple containing three integers a_i, b_i, c_i that satisfy specific conditions. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and it calls another function func_3 to generate these tuples. The generated list is then returned. However, the annotations mention parameters t and n, which are not utilized within the function, so their significance is unclear. Additionally, the specific conditions mentioned in the annotations regarding the range and inequality of a_i, b_i, c_i are not explicitly enforced within this function.
