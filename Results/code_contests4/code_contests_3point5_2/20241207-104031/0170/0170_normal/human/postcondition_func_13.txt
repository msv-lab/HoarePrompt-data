The function `func_14` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are integers satisfying 1 <= x <= 100 and 3 <= y <= 100. The function performs integer division of x by y and returns the quotient. If x is not perfectly divisible by y, it returns the integer division result incremented by 1.
