The function `func_15` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`. It performs a series of operations on `x` and `y` based on their values and returns the calculated result stored in 'res'. The function modifies `x` by taking the modulus of `x` with respect to `p`, then enters a loop where it updates `res`, `x`, and `y` iteratively. Inside the loop, if a condition is met, `res` is updated accordingly. Once the loop is completed, the function returns the final value stored in 'res'. The function does not handle any edge cases or missing logic mentioned in the annotations, so it solely computes the result based on the provided parameters.
