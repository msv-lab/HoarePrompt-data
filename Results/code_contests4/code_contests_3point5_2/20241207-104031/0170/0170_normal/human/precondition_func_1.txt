** The input consists of three sequences: a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, a list of n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, and a list of n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n. Each integer in the sequences is between 1 and 100. The length of the sequences is at least 3 and at most 100. For each i, a_i ≠ b_i, a_i ≠ c_i, and b_i ≠ c_i.
