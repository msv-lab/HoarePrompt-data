The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` and sorts it in reverse order based on a custom key function `getKey`. The function does not provide the implementation of the `getKey` function, so the sorting behavior is reliant on this external function. It is assumed that `getKey` is defined elsewhere in the codebase.
