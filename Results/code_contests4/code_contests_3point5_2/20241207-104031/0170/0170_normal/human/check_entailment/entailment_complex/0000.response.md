Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function func_19 seems to incorrectly assign values to the sequence p based on the conditions provided. The function does not ensure that no two adjacent elements in p have equal values from the sequences a, b, and c as required by the problem description. This can lead to incorrect sequences being generated.

An example where the code does not work correctly:
Input:
3
3
1 2 1
2 1 2
3 3 3

Expected Output:
1 2 1

Actual Output:
1 2 1

Explanation:
In this test case, the expected output is [1, 2, 1] where each element is from the sequences a, b, c, and no two adjacent elements are equal. The actual output matches the expected output in this case.
