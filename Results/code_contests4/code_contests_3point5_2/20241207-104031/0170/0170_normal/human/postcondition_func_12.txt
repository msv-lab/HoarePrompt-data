The function func_13 accepts an integer n and a list of lists r. It calculates the factorial of n and divides it by the product of the factorials of the elements in r and the factorial of max(n - r, 1). It then returns the result of this division. However, the code has a missing implementation for the factorial function, so the actual functionality is incomplete until the factorial function is defined.
