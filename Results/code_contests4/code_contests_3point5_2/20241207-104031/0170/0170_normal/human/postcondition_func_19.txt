The function func_20 does not accept any parameters. It operates on three sequences a, b, and c, each containing n distinct integers. The length of each sequence is between 3 and 100. The function prints the elements in the sequences to a stream, separated by spaces, and ends with a newline character. If the 'flush' keyword argument is set to True, it flushes the stream. The function does not return any value.
