Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be incorrect and does not handle the problem requirements properly. The program is trying to find the minimum number of good slices to make all towers have the same height, but the implementation is flawed.

Specifically, the logic inside the `func_1` function is not correct. It tries to iterate over a range of heights and calculates the total number of cubes above that height, but it does not correctly handle the condition for making slices and updating the count of slices.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the problem description, the program is incorrect and does not provide the expected output for the given problem.
