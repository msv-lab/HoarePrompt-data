You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a toy building consisting of n towers. Each tower consists of several cubes standing on each other. The i-th tower consists of h_i cubes, so it has height h_i.

Let's define operation slice on some height H as following: for each tower i, if its height is greater than H, then remove some top cubes to make tower's height equal to H. Cost of one "slice" equals to the total number of removed cubes from all towers.

Let's name slice as good one if its cost is lower or equal to k (k ≥ n).

<image>

Calculate the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same height. Of course, it is always possible to make it so.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of towers and the restriction on slices, respectively.

The second line contains n space separated integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the initial heights of towers.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same heigth.

Examples

Input

5 5
3 1 2 2 4


Output

2


Input

4 5
2 3 4 5


Output

2

Note

In the first example it's optimal to make 2 slices. The first slice is on height 2 (its cost is 3), and the second one is on height 1 (its cost is 4).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
