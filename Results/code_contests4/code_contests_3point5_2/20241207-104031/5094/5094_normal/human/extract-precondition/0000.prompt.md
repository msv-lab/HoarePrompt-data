You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: There is a toy building consisting of n towers. Each tower consists of several cubes standing on each other. The i-th tower consists of h_i cubes, so it has height h_i.

Let's define operation slice on some height H as following: for each tower i, if its height is greater than H, then remove some top cubes to make tower's height equal to H. Cost of one "slice" equals to the total number of removed cubes from all towers.

Let's name slice as good one if its cost is lower or equal to k (k ≥ n).

<image>

Calculate the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same height. Of course, it is always possible to make it so.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, n ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of towers and the restriction on slices, respectively.

The second line contains n space separated integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_n (1 ≤ h_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the initial heights of towers.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of good slices you have to do to make all towers have the same heigth.

Examples

Input

5 5
3 1 2 2 4


Output

2


Input

4 5
2 3 4 5


Output

2

Note

In the first example it's optimal to make 2 slices. The first slice is on height 2 (its cost is 3), and the second one is on height 1 (its cost is 4).

def func_1():
