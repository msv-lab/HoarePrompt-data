Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `tot`, `cnt`, `slices`, `i` are integers. If `i` is in the list `h`, then `tot` is incremented by the value of `h[i]`, `cnt` is set to 0, and `slices` is incremented by 1. If `cnt + tot > k`, then `cnt` is assigned the value of `tot`. If `cnt + tot <= k`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `tot`. `min(h)` is greater than 200001, and `i` starts at 200000.***
