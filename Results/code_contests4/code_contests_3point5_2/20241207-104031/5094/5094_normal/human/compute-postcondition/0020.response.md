Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `tot`, `slices`, `i`, `h`, `cnt` are integers. If `i` is in `h`, `tot` is incremented by `h[i]`, `slices` is incremented by 1, `min(h)` is greater than 200001, and `i` starts at 199999. If `cnt + tot > k`, `cnt` is assigned the value of `tot`. Otherwise, `cnt` is increased by the value of `tot`.***
