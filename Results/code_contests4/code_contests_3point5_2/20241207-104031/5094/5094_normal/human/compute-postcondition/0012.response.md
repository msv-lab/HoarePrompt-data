Output State: **`n`, `k`, `tot`, `cnt`, `slices`, `i` are integers. If `i` is in the list `h`, then `tot` is incremented by the value of `h[i]`, `cnt` is set to 0, `slices` is set to 0, `min(h)` is greater than 200001, and `i` starts at 200000. Additionally, `cnt + tot` is less than or equal to `k`. `cnt` is increased by the value of `tot`.**
