Output State: **`n`, `k`, `tot`, `cnt`, `slices` are integers; `i` is an integer starting at 200000. If `i` is in list `h`, then `tot` is incremented by the value of `h[i]`, `cnt` is set to 0, `slices` is incremented by 1. If `cnt + tot` is greater than `k`, then `cnt` is assigned the value of `tot`.**
