Example Answer:
The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element of the input split by space. The `Counter` function then creates a dictionary where keys are the unique elements of the input and values are the frequency of each element. The variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the specified range**
