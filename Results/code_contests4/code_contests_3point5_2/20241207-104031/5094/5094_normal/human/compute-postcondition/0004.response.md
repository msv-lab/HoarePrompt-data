According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range condition is met. In this case, the loop will execute if min(h) is greater than 200001. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the specified range, `tot` and `cnt` are initialized to 0, `slices` is 0, for the loop to execute `min(h)` is greater than 200001, `i` starts at 200000**
