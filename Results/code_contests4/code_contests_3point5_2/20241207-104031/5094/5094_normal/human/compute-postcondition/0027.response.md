Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `tot`, `slices`, `i`, `h`, `cnt` are variables where `n`, `k`, `tot` are incremented by `h[i]`, `slices` is incremented by 1, `i` is 199998, `h`, `cnt` are assigned the value of `tot` or increased by the value of `tot` based on the condition `cnt + tot > k` if `i` is in `h`. If `cnt + tot > k`, then `n`, `k`, `tot`, `slices + 1`, `i`, `h`, `cnt` are assigned the value of `tot`. Otherwise, `n`, `k`, `tot` are incremented by `h[i]`, `slices` is incremented by 1, `i` is 199998, `h`, `cnt` are assigned the value of `tot` or increased by the value of `tot` based on the condition `cnt + tot > k` if `i` is in `h`, and `cnt` is incremented by the value of `tot`.***
