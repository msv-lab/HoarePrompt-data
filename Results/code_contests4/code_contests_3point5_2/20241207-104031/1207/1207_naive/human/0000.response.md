Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes in the input values of n and r.
2. It calculates the area of the star figure based on the formula provided in the problem description.
3. The formula used in the program is derived mathematically for the given scenario of constructing a star figure with n corners and a radius r.
4. The program uses the math module to access functions like sin to perform the calculations accurately.
5. The output is a single number representing the area of the star figure, which matches the expected output format.
6. The program does not have any logical errors or edge cases that are not handled, ensuring that it works correctly for all valid inputs.
