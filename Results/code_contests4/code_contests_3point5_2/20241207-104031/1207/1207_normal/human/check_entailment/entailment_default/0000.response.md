Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly calculates the area of a star figure based on the input values of `n` and `r` as described in the problem. The formula used in the code aligns with the geometric construction of the star figure and the mathematical principles involved in calculating its area. Additionally, the constraints mentioned in the problem description are also satisfied within the code. Since the code performs the required calculation accurately and handles the input constraints appropriately, it can be considered correct for all potential cases.
