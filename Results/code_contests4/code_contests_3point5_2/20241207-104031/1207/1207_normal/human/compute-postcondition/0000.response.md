Example Answer:
`n` and `r` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it by whitespace, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split value to an integer. Given that `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 5 and `r` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the output state is: n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
