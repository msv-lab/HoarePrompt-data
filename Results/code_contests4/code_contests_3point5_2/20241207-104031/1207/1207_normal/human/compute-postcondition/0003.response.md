Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans` based on the initial state provided. Without knowing the specific formula used to calculate `ans` based on `n`, `r`, and `pi`, we can't determine the exact value. However, since `n` is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, `r` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `pi` is 3.141592653589793, the value of `ans` would be a calculated result based on these values.
Output State: **output state**
