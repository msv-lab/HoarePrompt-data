The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the value of n^r - r^n. The constraints for the parameters are that n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5, and r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the value of n^r - r^n where n is a prime number greater than or equal to 5 and r is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
