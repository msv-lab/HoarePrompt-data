Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly identify the episode that Polycarpus has not watched. The program calculates the sum of the episodes watched by Polycarpus and then subtracts it from the sum of all episodes to find the missing episode. However, this approach will not work if the episodes are not in sequential order or if there are duplicate episodes in the list. 

For example, if the input is:
```
10
3 8 10 1 7 9 6 5 2
```
The expected output should be `4`, but the program will output a different incorrect result because it simply calculates the sum and subtracts it from the sum of all episodes.
