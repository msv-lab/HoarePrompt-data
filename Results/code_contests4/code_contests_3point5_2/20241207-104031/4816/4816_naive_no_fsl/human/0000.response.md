Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the total number of episodes `n` and the list of episodes watched by Polycarpus as input. It then calculates the sum of watched episodes and subtracts it from the sum of the arithmetic progression from 1 to `n` to find the missing episode.

The logic of the program is correct as it follows the problem description accurately. It handles the input format specified and calculates the missing episode correctly. The program iterates over the watched episodes list and sums them up, then subtracts this sum from the sum of the arithmetic progression to find the missing episode.

Since the program works correctly for all potential cases and follows the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
