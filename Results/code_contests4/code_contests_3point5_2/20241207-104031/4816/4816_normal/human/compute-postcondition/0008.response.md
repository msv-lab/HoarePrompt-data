Example Answer:
The value of `sum` is updated by adding the value of `num`. The value of `num` is not specified in the initial state, so the final value of `sum` depends on the initial values of `sum` and `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N+1, n is an integer between 2 and 100000, `sum` is updated by adding `num`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N+1, n is an integer between 2 and 100000, `sum` is updated by adding `num`**
