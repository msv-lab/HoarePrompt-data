Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `N` converted to an integer. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `n` will also be an integer between 2 and 100000. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000. NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N-1, where each element is an integer between 1 and N, inclusive, and all elements are distinct; n is an integer between 2 and 100000.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000. NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N-1, where each element is an integer between 1 and N, inclusive, and all elements are distinct; n is an integer between 2 and 100000.**
