Example Answer:
The value of `num` will be the next element in the list `NUMBERS` for the next iteration. The current value of `sum` will be updated by adding `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N, n is an integer between 2 and 100000, `sum` is updated by adding `num`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N, n is an integer between 2 and 100000, `sum` is updated by adding `num`**
