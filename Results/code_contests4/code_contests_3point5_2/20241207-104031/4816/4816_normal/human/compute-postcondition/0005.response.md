According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the NUMBERS list to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N-1, n is an integer between 2 and 100000, sum is updated with the addition of num. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in the NUMBERS list needs to be accessed by incrementing the index.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N, n is an integer between 2 and 100000, sum is updated with the addition of num, for the loop to execute the next time num will be the next element in the NUMBERS list**
