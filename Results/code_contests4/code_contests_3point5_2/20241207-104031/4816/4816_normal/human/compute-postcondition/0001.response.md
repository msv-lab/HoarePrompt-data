Example Answer:
Each element in the list `NUMBERS` is converted to an integer using list comprehension and assigned to the list `numbers`. Since `NUMBERS` is a string with integers separated by spaces, after splitting it and converting the elements to integers, the list `numbers` will contain N-1 integers. The values of `N` and `n` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N-1, where each element is an integer between 1 and N, inclusive, and all elements are distinct; n is an integer between 2 and 100000**
