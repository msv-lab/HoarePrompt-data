According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list NUMBERS. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list NUMBERS must have at least 1 element. At the start of the loop, the sum is 0. To execute the loop for the first time, num should be the first element in the NUMBERS list. 
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, NUMBERS is a list of integers with length N-1, where each element is an integer between 1 and N, inclusive, and all elements are distinct; n is an integer between 2 and 100000, sum is 0, for the loop to execute the first time num is the first element in the NUMBERS list**
