Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `N`, an integer where 2 <= N <= 100000, and `NUMBERS`, a list of integers with length N-1, where each element is an integer between 1 and N, inclusive, and all elements are distinct. The function calculates the sum of all elements in the NUMBERS list, subtracts it from the sum of integers from 1 to N, and prints the result. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
