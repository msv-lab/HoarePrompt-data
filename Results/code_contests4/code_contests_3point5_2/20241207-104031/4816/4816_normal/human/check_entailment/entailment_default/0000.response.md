The code provided defines a function `func_1` that calculates the episode that Polycarpus has not watched based on the sum of the episodes he has watched. The code takes the input for the total number of episodes and the list of watched episodes, calculates the sum of watched episodes, subtracts it from the sum of all episodes, and prints the missing episode number.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the missing episode by summing the watched episodes and subtracting it from the sum of all episodes. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function calculates the sum of watched episodes and subtracts it from the sum of all episodes.

Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
