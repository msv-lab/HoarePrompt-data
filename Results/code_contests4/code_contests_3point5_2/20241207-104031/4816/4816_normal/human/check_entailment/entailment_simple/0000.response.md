Correctness: **True**

The annotated program takes the input N and a list of watched episodes NUMBERS, calculates the sum of the watched episodes, and then calculates the number of the episode that Polycarpus hasn't watched by subtracting the sum of the watched episodes from the sum of all episodes.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly identifies the episode that Polycarpus has not watched by calculating the missing episode number. It works for all possible cases as it accurately calculates the missing episode based on the sum of watched episodes and the total sum.
