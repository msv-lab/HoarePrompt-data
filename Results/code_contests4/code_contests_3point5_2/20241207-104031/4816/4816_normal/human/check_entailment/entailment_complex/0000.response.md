Correctness: **True**

The provided program takes the input `N` and `NUMBERS`, calculates the sum of all elements in `NUMBERS`, then subtracts this sum from the sum of integers from 1 to `N`. Finally, it prints the result, which corresponds to the episode number that Polycarpus hasn't watched.

The program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It correctly identifies the missing episode number based on the input provided. Hence, the program is correct.
