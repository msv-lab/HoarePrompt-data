Correctness: **False**

The given program does not generate the correct test cases as per the problem description. It has hardcoded logic for specific ranges of input values, which may not be valid for all cases. For example, for input 18, the program should output denominations [1, 5, 10, 25] to make 30 cents, but the program does not handle this case correctly. Additionally, the program may not produce valid test cases for all possible values of A.
