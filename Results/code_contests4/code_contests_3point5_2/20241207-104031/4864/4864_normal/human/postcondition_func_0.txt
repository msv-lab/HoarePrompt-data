The function `func` reads an integer input from standard input, and based on the value of the input, it constructs a list `nom` with specific elements. The function then prints out the values of `change` and the length of `nom`, followed by the elements of `nom` separated by spaces. The function operates without any explicit input parameters and is designed to handle different input ranges of `n` to generate the list `nom` accordingly. If `n` falls within specific ranges, the function constructs `nom` with predetermined elements. If `n` is not within the predefined ranges, the function appends elements to `nom` until its length reaches 10 or `n % 10 + 2`. The program then exits with status code 0.
