Example Answer:
After executing the code, the value of `res_` is calculated as 1000000 divided by `res`, and since `res` is a multiple of 10 less than `n`, `res` is a multiple of 10 less than `n`. `nom` appends the result of the division to its list. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1 and the result of 1000000 divided by res.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1 and the result of 1000000 divided by res**
