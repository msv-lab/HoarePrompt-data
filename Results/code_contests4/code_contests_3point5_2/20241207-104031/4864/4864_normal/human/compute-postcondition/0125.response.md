Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the updated integer input from standard input, `change` is 999999, `nom` is a list containing values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2 based on the condition and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
