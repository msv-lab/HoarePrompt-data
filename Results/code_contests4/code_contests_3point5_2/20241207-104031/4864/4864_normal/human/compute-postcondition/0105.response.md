Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. The value of `n` is the integer input from standard input. Therefore, `res` will be calculated based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 100000, the program will exit with status code 0. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; if `n` is 100000, the program exits with status code 0**
