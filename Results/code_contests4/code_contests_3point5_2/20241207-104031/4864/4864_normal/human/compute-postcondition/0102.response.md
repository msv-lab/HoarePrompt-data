Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the string '1 9' by concatenating the integer values 1 and 9 after converting them to strings. The variables A, n, change, and nom are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1**
