Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is either 10000 or 1000000 based on the value of `n`, `nom` is a list containing elements based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts. If 1000 < n <= 10000, `nom` will contain 1, 1, 999998, 999997, 999996, 999995, 999994, 999993, 999992, 999991, 999990. If n is not in the range (10 < n <= 100), `nom` will contain values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2 based on the condition. If the length of `nom` becomes 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
