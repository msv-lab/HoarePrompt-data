According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 999999. The loop decrements `x` by 1 in each iteration. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be 999998.
State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 999998 for the loop to execute a second time, `nom` contains the value 999999**
