Example Answer:
`res` is calculated as `n - (non-zero value) - 1`. Then, `res_` is calculated as `1000000` divided by `res`. Finally, `res_` is appended to the list `nom`. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1 and the calculated `res_` value.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1 and the calculated `res_` value**
