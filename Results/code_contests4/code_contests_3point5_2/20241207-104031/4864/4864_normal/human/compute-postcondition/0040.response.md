Example Answer:
`res_` is assigned the value of `change` divided by `res`. Since `res` is calculated as `n - (non-zero value) - 1`, and `change` is 1000000, the value of `res_` will be 1000000 divided by the calculated value of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1; `res` is the result of `n - (non-zero value) - 1; `res_` is the result of 1000000 divided by `res`.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1; `res` is the result of `n - (non-zero value) - 1; `res_` is the result of 1000000 divided by `res`**
