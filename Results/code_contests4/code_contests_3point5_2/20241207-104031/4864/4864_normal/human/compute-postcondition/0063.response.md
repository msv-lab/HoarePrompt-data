Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, the calculated `res_` value, 999999, and the remaining elements added by the loop until the length of `nom` is equal to 10 or `n % 10 + 2`. If the loop does not execute, `nom` will contain only 1 and the calculated `res_` value.**
