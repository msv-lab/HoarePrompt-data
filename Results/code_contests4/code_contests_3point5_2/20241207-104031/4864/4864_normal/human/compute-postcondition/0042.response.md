According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range provided has more than one element. In this case, the loop will execute as long as x is greater than 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1 and the calculated `res_` value, and `x` is 1000000 - 1.
State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1 and the calculated `res_` value; `x` is 999999**
