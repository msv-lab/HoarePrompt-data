According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range specified in the for loop is valid. In this case, the loop will execute as long as x is in the range [1000000 - 1, 0) with a step size of -1. The loop will not execute if the starting value is already less than the ending value due to the negative step size.

Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; for the loop to execute `x` is in the range [1000000 - 1, 0) with a step size of -1**
