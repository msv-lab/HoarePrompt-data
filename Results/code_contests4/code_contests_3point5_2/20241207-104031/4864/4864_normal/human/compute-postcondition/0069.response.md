Example Answer:
The code does not affect any of the provided initial state variables. It simply prints the string '1 9'. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing 1; the output of the print statement is '1 9'.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing 1; the output of the print statement is '1 9'**
