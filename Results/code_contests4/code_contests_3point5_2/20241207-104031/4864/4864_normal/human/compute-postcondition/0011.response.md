Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 999999 for the loop to execute a second time. If the length of `nom` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
