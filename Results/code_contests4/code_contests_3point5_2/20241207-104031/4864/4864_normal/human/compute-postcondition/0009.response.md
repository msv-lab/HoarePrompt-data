According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is within the range 1 to 105, `n` is a user input integer, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1 with `x` appended to it, `x` is 1000000, and we broke out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `x` needs to be decremented by 1.
State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 999999 for the loop to execute a second time**
