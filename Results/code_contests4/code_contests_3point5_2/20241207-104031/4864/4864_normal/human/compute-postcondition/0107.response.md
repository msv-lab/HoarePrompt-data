Example Answer:
`res_` is appended to the `nom` list. The value of `res_` is not provided in the initial state, so it's unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; if `n` is 100000, the program exits with status code 0.
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; if `n` is 100000, the program exits with status code 0**
