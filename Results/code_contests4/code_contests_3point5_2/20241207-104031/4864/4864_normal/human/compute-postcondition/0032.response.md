According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. At the end of the last iteration, x is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time x must be 0. Additionally, if the length of nom is equal to 10, we break out of the loop. Since nom contains 1 initially and x is appended each iteration, for x to be 999998, the length of nom should be 999988.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, n is the integer input from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing 999988, the result of 1000000 divided by res, and x if appended, for the loop to execute x is 0**
