According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `A`, `n`, `change`, and `nom`. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer between 1 and 105, n is the input integer, change is 999999, and nom is a list containing values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `A` remains the same as it is not mentioned that it changes within the loop.
- `n` should be updated based on the input from standard input.
- `change` remains the same at 999999.
- For `nom`:
  - If the length of nom is currently 10, then the loop will not execute again, so no more values need to be appended to nom.
  - If the length of nom is currently equal to n % 10 + 2, then the loop will not execute again, so no more values need to be appended to nom.
  - If the length of nom is not 10 and not equal to n % 10 + 2, then values of x need to continue being appended to nom until one of the break conditions is met.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the updated integer input from standard input, `change` is 999999, `nom` is a list containing values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2 based on the condition**.
