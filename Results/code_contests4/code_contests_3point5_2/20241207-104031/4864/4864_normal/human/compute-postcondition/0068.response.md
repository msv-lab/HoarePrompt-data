Example Answer:
`change` is assigned the value 10000, and `nom` is a list containing 1. The `print` statement outputs the string concatenation of `change` and '2'. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing 1; The output of the print statement is '10000 2'.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing 1; The output of the print statement is '10000 2'**
