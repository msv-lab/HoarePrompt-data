Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `nom`. Initially, `nom` contains 1 and the result of 1000000 divided by `res`. After appending `x`, `nom` will have 1, the result of 1000000 divided by `res`, and `x`. If the length of `nom` becomes equal to 10, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, n is the integer input from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing 1, the result of 1000000 divided by res, and x if appended, for the loop to execute x is 999999. If the length of nom is equal to 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
