Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1 and the calculated `res_` value; `x` is 999999. The length of `nom` is not equal to 10. The length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
