According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing elements 1, 1, and 999998, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, and `x` is currently 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 1.
State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing elements 1, 1, and 999998, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `x` must be greater than 1**
