Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1, the calculated `res_` value, and 999999. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10 or the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
