Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1 and the calculated `res_` value; `x` is 999999. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10 but equal to `n % 10 + 2`, then we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
