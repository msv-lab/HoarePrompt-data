Example Answer:
After executing the code `nom.append(x)`, the value of `x` is appended to the list `nom`. The loop will iterate from 1000000 - 1 to 0 with a step size of -1, adding each value of `x` to the list `nom`. If the length of `nom` becomes 10, we break out of the loop. If not, the length of `nom` will be updated to `n % 10 + 2`. 
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2 based on the condition.**
