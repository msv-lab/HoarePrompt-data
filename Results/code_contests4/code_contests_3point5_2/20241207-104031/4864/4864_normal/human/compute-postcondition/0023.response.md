According to the code, the loop will execute as long as x is within the range of (1000000 - 1, 0, -1). The loop will execute 999999 times. Before the loop starts, A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105 does not directly influence the loop execution, so it needs to be adjusted to x is 999999, n is the input integer from standard input, change is 1000000, and nom is a list containing 1 and the result of 1000000 divided by res.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, n is the integer input from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing 1 and the result of 1000000 divided by res, for the loop to execute x is 999999**
