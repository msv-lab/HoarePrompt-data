Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1; for the loop to execute x is in the range [1000000 - 1, 0) with a step size of -1. If the length of nom is 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of nom is not equal to 10, the length of nom is equal to n % 10 + 2.***
