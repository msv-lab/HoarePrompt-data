Example Answer:
`change` is assigned the value 1000000, `n` is the input integer, `nom` is a list containing 1. The values of `A` and other variables are not affected by the given code snippet. After execution, the code prints the string concatenation of '1000000 2'. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1. 
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1**
