Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, n is the integer input from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing 999988, the result of 1000000 divided by res, and x if appended, for the loop to execute x is 0. If the length of nom is 10, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
