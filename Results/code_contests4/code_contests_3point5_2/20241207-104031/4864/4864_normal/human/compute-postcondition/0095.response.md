Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing elements 1, 1, 999998, and 1, `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `x` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `x` must be greater than 1. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `nom` is not equal to 10, but to n % 10 + 2, then the program state remains unchanged.**
