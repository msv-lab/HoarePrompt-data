Example Answer:
The value of `res` is calculated by subtracting the remainder of dividing `n` by 10 from `n` and then subtracting 1. Since `n` is an integer greater than 10 and less than or equal to 100, the value of `res` will be a multiple of 10 less than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1. res is a multiple of 10 less than n.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1. res is a multiple of 10 less than n.**
