According to the code, the loop will execute until x reaches 0. At the end of the last iteration, A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105. To execute the loop again, x needs to be decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, A remains the same and n remains the same, but change becomes 999999 and nom is updated based on the condition mentioned in the loop.
State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 999999; nom is a list containing values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2 based on the condition**
