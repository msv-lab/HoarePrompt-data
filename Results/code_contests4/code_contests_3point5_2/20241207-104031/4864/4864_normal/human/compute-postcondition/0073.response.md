Example Answer:
The value of `res` is calculated as n - n % 10 - 1. If n is input as 10000, then res would be 9999. The value of `change` is 10000, so res_ would be calculated as 10000 // 9999, which is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing 1; if n == 10000, the output of the print statement is '1 9'; res is 9999; res_ is 1.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 10000; nom is a list containing 1; if n == 10000, the output of the print statement is '1 9'; res is 9999; res_ is 1**
