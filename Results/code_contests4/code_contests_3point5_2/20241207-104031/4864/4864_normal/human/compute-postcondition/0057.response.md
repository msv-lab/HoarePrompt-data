According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and the conditions related to the length of the `nom` list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, the calculated `res_` value, 999999, `x` is greater than 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions related to the length of the `nom` list. 

If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is equal to n % 10 + 3, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, the calculated `res_` value, 999999, `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nom` must be either 10 or n % 10 + 3**
