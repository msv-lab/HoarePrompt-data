According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and the range specified in the for loop. Since the range starts from 1000000 - 1 and goes down to 0, the loop will definitely execute. Before the loop starts, the important states that need to be adjusted are `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 1, if `n` == 10000, the output of the print statement is '1 9', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `nom` is a list containing 1, 1, and `x` is 1000000 - 1. 

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 1, if `n` == 10000, the output of the print statement is '1 9', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `nom` is a list containing 1, 1, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is 999999**
