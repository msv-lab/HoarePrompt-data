Example Answer:
`res_` is assigned the value of `change // res`. Since `change` is 1000000 and `res` is a multiple of 10 less than `n`, we can calculate `res_` as 1000000 divided by the value of `res`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1; res is a multiple of 10 less than n; res_ is the result of 1000000 divided by res.
