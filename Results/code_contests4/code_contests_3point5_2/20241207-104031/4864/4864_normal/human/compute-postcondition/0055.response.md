Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, the calculated `res_` value, and 999999, `x` is greater than 1. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is equal to n % 10 + 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
