Example Answer:
`res` is assigned the value of `n - n % 10 - 1`. Since `n` is larger than 10 and not in the range (10 < n <= 100), `n % 10` will be a non-zero value, resulting in `res` being `n - (non-zero value) - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1. `res` is the result of `n - (non-zero value) - 1`.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1. `res` is the result of `n - (non-zero value) - 1**.
