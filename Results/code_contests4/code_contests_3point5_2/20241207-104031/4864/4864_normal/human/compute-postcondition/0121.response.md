Postcondition: ***A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 999999; nom is a list containing values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2 based on the condition. If the length of nom is equal to 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the length of nom is equal to n % 10 + 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
