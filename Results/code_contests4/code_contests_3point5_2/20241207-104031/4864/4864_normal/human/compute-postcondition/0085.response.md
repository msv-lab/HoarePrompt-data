Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list containing 1, if `n` == 10000, the output of the print statement is '1 9', `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1, `nom` is a list containing 1, 1, for the loop to execute the second time `x` is 999998. The length of `nom` is equal to 10 if the condition is met, otherwise, the length of `nom` is equal to `n` % 10 + 2, `nom` now contains an additional element `x`**
