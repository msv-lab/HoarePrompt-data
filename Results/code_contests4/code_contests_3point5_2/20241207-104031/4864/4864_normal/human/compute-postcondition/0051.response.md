According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `x` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, the calculated `res_` value, and 999999. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10 or the length of `nom` is equal to `n % 10 + 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than 1.
State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, the calculated `res_` value, and 999999, `x` is greater than 1**
