Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 999999, `nom` is a list containing values of x appended in the loop until the length becomes 10 or is updated to n % 10 + 2 based on the condition. If the length of `nom` becomes 10, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
