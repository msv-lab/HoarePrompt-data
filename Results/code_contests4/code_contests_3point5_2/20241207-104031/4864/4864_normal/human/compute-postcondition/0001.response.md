Example Answer:
`change` is assigned the value `1000000`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000**
