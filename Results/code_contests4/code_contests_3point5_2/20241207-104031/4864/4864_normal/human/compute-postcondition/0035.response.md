Example Answer:
`x` is appended to the list `nom`, which initially contains 999988 elements. After the append operation, the length of `nom` becomes 999989. Since the length of `nom` is not 10, the program continues to run. The value of `x` is 0, as specified. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, n is the integer input from standard input, change is 1000000, nom is a list containing 999989 elements, the result of 1000000 divided by res, and x if appended, for the loop to execute x is 0.
