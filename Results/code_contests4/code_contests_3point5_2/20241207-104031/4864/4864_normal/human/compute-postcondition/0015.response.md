Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 999998 for the loop to execute a second time, `nom` contains the value 999999, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited after the condition `len(nom) == n` is met.***
