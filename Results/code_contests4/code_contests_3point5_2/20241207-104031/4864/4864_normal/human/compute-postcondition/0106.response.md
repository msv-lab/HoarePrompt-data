Example Answer:
`res_` is assigned the result of `change // res` where `change` is 1000000 and `res` is the value of `res` which is not given. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; if `n` is 100000, the program exits with status code 0.
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; if `n` is 100000, the program exits with status code 0**
