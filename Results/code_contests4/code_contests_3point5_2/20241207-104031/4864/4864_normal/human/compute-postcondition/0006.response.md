Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 1000000, for the loop to execute the first time. The length of `nom` is equal to `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
