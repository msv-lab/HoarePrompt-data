According to the code, the loop will execute as long as x is in the range from 1000000 to 1 (inclusive) with a step of -1. The loop will execute for a total of 1000000 times. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted are:
- x is 1000000
- A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105
- n is the integer input from standard input
- change is 1000000
- nom is a list containing 1, n is less than or equal to 10

State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 1000000, `nom` is a list containing 1, `n` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 1000000, for the loop to execute the first time**
