Postcondition: ***`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input from standard input, `change` is 10000, `nom` is a list. If the length of `nom` is equal to 10, then `nom` contains elements 1, 1, and `x` where `x` is 999998. Otherwise, if the length of `nom` is not 10, the length of `nom` is equal to `n` % 10 + 2 and `nom` contains elements 1, 1. The output of the print statement is '1 9' if `n` == 10000. `res` is 9999, `res_` is 1.***
