Example Answer: 
The value of `change` is determined based on the value of `n`, which is the input integer. The value of `nom` is determined based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts. After executing the code, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `A` ≤ 105, `n` is the integer input, `change` is either 10000 or 1000000 based on the value of `n`, `nom` is a list containing elements based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts, and the result of 1000000 divided by res.**
