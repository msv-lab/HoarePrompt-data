Output State: **`A` is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input; `change` is 1000000; `nom` is a list containing 1; for the loop to execute `x` is in the range [1000000 - 1, 0) with a step size of -1. The length of `nom` is equal to 10 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
