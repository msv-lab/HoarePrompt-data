Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the integer value obtained from reading a line from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`. The value of `n` will be the integer input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; `n` is the integer input from standard input.**
