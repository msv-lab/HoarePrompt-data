Example Answer:
`nom` is assigned a list containing the integer 1. `A`, `n`, and `change` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1.
Output State: **A is an integer such that 1 ≤ A ≤ 105; n is the integer input from standard input; change is 1000000; nom is a list containing 1**
