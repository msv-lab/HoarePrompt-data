Correctness: **True**

The program correctly generates test cases to produce a given number of ways to make change, as described in the problem description. It handles different ranges of input values and generates the denominations of the coins accordingly. The program ensures that the denominations are distinct and that the total number of ways to make change matches the given input.

The program logic follows the problem description closely, generating test cases that satisfy the requirements specified in the problem. The program handles different scenarios based on the input value and produces the desired output format. Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and produces valid test cases.
