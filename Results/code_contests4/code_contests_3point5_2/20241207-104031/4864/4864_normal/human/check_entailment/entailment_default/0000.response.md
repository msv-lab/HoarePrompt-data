Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code generates the list `nom` based on different ranges of the input `n`, but there are certain scenarios where the code may not produce the expected output. For example, when `n` falls between 1000 and 10000, the code incorrectly prints denominations of coins that do not match the number of ways specified. In this case, the program does not handle the scenario where `n` is between 1000 and 10000 correctly, causing it to not follow the problem description.

Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and confirm the functionality described, but they do not cover all potential cases where the code may deviate from the problem description. Therefore, based on both the code analysis and the output hints, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
