Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer input `n`, then based on the value of `n`, it constructs a list `nom` containing denominations of coins. The program then outputs the amount of change and the number of denominations, followed by the denominations themselves.

The program covers different ranges of `n` and constructs the list `nom` accordingly, ensuring that the output test case will have the desired number of ways to make change. It handles the cases where `n` falls within specific ranges by predefining the elements of `nom`, and for other cases, it appends elements to `nom` until its length reaches 10 or `n % 10 + 2`.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and generates test cases to produce the given number of ways to make change.
