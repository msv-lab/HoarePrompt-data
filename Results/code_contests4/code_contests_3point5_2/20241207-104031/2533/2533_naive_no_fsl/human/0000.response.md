Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the earliest time moment in which Igor is able to catch all the mice by determining if they are strictly inside the mousetrap. It considers the initial coordinates of the mice, their speeds, and the coordinates of the mousetrap to make this determination. The program handles cases where the mice are moving towards the mousetrap, as well as cases where the mice are not moving towards the mousetrap. The logic used to calculate the time to catch all the mice is sound and the output is within the expected format.
