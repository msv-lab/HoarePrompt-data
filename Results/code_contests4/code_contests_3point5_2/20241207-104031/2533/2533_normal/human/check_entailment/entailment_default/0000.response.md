Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately reads the input values for the number of mice, mousetrap coordinates, and mice initial positions and speeds.
- It correctly calculates the earliest time moment in which Igor is able to catch all the mice by determining the optimal time to close the mousetrap.
- The code handles cases where the mice are moving towards the mousetrap, and when the mice are already within the mousetrap boundaries.
- It accounts for scenarios where a mouse's speed is zero, indicating that it is stationary.
- The output is the minimum possible non-negative number 't' such that if the mousetrap is closed at 't' seconds from the beginning, then all the mice are strictly inside the mousetrap.

Overall, the code follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases based on the given inputs and specifications.
