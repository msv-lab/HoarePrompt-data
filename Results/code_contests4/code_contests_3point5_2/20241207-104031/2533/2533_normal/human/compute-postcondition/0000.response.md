According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines being input from the standard input (sys.stdin). Since there is no specific condition mentioned in the for loop statement, the loop will continue to execute until there are no more lines to read.

State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000. rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000. for the loop to execute, there are lines being input from sys.stdin**
