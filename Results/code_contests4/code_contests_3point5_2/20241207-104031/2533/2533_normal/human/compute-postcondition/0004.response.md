Example Answer:
The code snippet is using a generator function with the `yield` keyword to produce a value. The values of the variables `n`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `rix`, `riy`, `vix`, and `viy` are not directly affected by this code snippet. The function will keep yielding a value as long as there are inputs from `sys.stdin`.
Output State: **No change in the variables, the generator function will continue yielding values as long as there are inputs from sys.stdin**
