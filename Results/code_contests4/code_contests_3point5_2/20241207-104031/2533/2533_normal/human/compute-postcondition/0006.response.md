Example Answer:
The generator function yields the value received as input from sys.stdin. The function will continue yielding values as long as there are inputs from sys.stdin. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the variables, the generator function will continue yielding values as long as there are inputs from sys.stdin.
Output State: **No change in the variables, the generator function will continue yielding values as long as there are inputs from sys.stdin**
