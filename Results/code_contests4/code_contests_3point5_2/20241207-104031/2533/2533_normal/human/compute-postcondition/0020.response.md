Example Answer:
The code snippet `yield value` indicates the generator function will yield a value. The variables and initial state provided do not directly impact the execution of the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, `line` contains at least one value that can be split and the generator function yields a value.
