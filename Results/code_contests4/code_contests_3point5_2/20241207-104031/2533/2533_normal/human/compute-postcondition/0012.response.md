Example Answer:
The code snippet `yield value` does not affect the variables n, x1, y1, x2, y2, rix, riy, vix, or viy. The yield statement is used in Python generators to produce a series of values over time, but in this case, it doesn't impact the current state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000**
