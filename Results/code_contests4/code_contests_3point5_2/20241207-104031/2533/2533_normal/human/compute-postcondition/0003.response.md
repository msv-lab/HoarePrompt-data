According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are values being input from sys.stdin. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more values available from sys.stdin.
State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000.
