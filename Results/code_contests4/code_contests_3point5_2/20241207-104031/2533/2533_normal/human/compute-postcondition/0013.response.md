According to the code, the loop executes for each value in the line.split(). So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more value in the line to split. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer. To execute the loop again, there needs to be at least one more value in the line to split.
State: **n is a positive integer, one more value is needed in line.split() for the loop to execute one more time**
