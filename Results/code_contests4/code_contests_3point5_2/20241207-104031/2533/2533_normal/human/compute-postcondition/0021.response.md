According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `line` variable which contains values that can be split. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer. To execute the loop again, `line` must contain at least one more value that can be split.
State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, `line` contains at least two values that can be split and the generator function yields a value**
