According to the code, the loop can execute if there are values in the `line` variable that can be split. Since `line` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we assume that it contains some values that can be split. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `line` should contain at least one value that can be split. 
State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, `line` contains at least one value that can be split**
