Example Answer:
`value` is yielded by the code snippet. The loop will execute one more time as one more value is needed in line.split(). Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, one more value is needed in line.split() for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, one more value is needed in line.split() for the loop to execute one more time**
