According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more lines to read from the input stream `sys.stdin`. At the end of the previous iteration, the variables have certain values. For the loop to execute one more time, the input stream `sys.stdin` must have more lines to read.
State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000**
