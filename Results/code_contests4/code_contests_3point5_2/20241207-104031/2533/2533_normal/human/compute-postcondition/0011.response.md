According to the code, the loop execution depends on the input values from sys.stdin. Since the loop is iterating over values obtained from splitting a line, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more values available from sys.stdin. 

State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, for the loop to execute there are more values available from sys.stdin**
