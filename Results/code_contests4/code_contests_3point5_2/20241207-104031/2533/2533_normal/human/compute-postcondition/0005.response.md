According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are inputs from sys.stdin. Since there are no changes in the variables at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute again for the next input from sys.stdin.
State: **No change in the variables, the generator function will continue yielding values as long as there are inputs from sys.stdin**
