Example Answer:
The code snippet contains a `yield` statement which is used in Python to create a generator function. The `yield` statement can be used to produce a series of values for iteration. The values of the variables provided in the initial state are not directly affected by the `yield` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, `line` contains at least one value that can be split.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, `line` contains at least one value that can be split**
