According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are values in `line` to split. At the end of the last iteration, there were values in `line` to split. For the loop to execute one more time, `line` must still contain at least one value that can be split.
State: **n is a positive integer, x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 100000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 100000, rix, riy, vix, viy are integers such that 0 <= rix, riy <= 100000 and -100000 <= vix, viy <= 100000, `line` contains at least one value that can be split**
