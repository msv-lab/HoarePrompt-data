Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and calculates the earliest time moment in which Igor can catch all the mice based on their initial positions and speeds. It considers all edge cases such as when the mouse is already within the mousetrap, when the mouse is moving towards or away from the mousetrap, and when the mouse's speed is zero. The program handles these cases and provides the correct output. Additionally, it accounts for scenarios where there might not be a valid time for Igor to catch all the mice. Overall, the logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all possible scenarios.
