You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. Two binary strings a and b of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer i such that a_i = b_i). For example:

  * 10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position 4); 
  * 10010 and 11111 are similar; 
  * 111 and 111 are similar; 
  * 0110 and 1001 are not similar. 



You are given an integer n and a binary string s consisting of 2n-1 characters. Let's denote s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of s starting with l-th character and ending with r-th character (in other words, s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} ... s_r).

You have to construct a binary string w of length n which is similar to all of the following strings: s[1..n], s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n-1].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line of each test case contains the binary string s of length 2n - 1. Each character s_i is either 0 or 1.

Output

For each test case, print the corresponding binary string w of length n. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string w meeting the constraints always exists.

Example

Input


4
1
1
3
00000
4
1110000
2
101


Output


1
000
1010
00

Note

The explanation of the sample case (equal characters in equal positions are bold):

The first test case: 

  * 1 is similar to s[1..1] = 1. 



The second test case: 

  * 000 is similar to s[1..3] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[2..4] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[3..5] = 000. 



The third test case: 

  * 1010 is similar to s[1..4] = 1110; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[2..5] = 1100; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[3..6] = 1000; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[4..7] = 0000. 



The fourth test case: 

  * 00 is similar to s[1..2] = 10; 
  * 00 is similar to s[2..3] = 01. 
Program:
```
_interactive = False

def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(s[::2])
INF = float('inf')
MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
alphabets = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    input = raw_input
    range = xrange
    filter = itertools.ifilter
    map = itertools.imap
    zip = itertools.izip
if _interactive:
    flush = sys.stdout.flush

    def printf(*args, **kwargs):
        print(*args, **kwargs)
        flush()

debug_print = print if LOCAL else lambda *x, **y: None
if not LOCAL and (not _interactive):
    from io import BytesIO
    from atexit import register
    sys.stdin = BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size))
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')

def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]

def func_3(o):
    return [int(x) + o for x in input().split()]

def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]

def func_5(f, *dim):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
func_1()
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
