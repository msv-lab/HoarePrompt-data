Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads the input correctly, processes each test case by extracting the required substrings according to the problem description, and prints the corresponding binary string `w` of length `n`. It follows the given constraints and logic as described in the problem statement. Additionally, as the problem guarantees that at least one string `w` meeting the constraints always exists, there is no need to worry about the correctness of the output.
