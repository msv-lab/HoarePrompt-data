Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the value of `s` is the string input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input**
