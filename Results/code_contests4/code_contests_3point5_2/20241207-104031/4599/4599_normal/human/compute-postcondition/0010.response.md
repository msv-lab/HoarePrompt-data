Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts a string input. The value of `n` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string input**
