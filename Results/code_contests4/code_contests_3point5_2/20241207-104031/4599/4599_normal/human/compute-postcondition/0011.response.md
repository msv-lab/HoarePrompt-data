Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints every second character of the string `s` starting from the first character. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string input, and the output of the code snippet is every second character of the string `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string input, and the output of the code snippet is every second character of the string `s`**
