According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input integer `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the new value of `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a string input**
