You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. Two binary strings a and b of equal length are similar, if they have the same character in some position (there exists an integer i such that a_i = b_i). For example:

  * 10010 and 01111 are similar (they have the same character in position 4); 
  * 10010 and 11111 are similar; 
  * 111 and 111 are similar; 
  * 0110 and 1001 are not similar. 



You are given an integer n and a binary string s consisting of 2n-1 characters. Let's denote s[l..r] as the contiguous substring of s starting with l-th character and ending with r-th character (in other words, s[l..r] = s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} ... s_r).

You have to construct a binary string w of length n which is similar to all of the following strings: s[1..n], s[2..n+1], s[3..n+2], ..., s[n..2n-1].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The second line of each test case contains the binary string s of length 2n - 1. Each character s_i is either 0 or 1.

Output

For each test case, print the corresponding binary string w of length n. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them. It can be shown that at least one string w meeting the constraints always exists.

Note

The explanation of the sample case (equal characters in equal positions are bold):

The first test case: 

  * 1 is similar to s[1..1] = 1. 



The second test case: 

  * 000 is similar to s[1..3] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[2..4] = 000; 
  * 000 is similar to s[3..5] = 000. 



The third test case: 

  * 1010 is similar to s[1..4] = 1110; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[2..5] = 1100; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[3..6] = 1000; 
  * 1010 is similar to s[4..7] = 0000. 



The fourth test case: 

  * 00 is similar to s[1..2] = 10; 
  * 00 is similar to s[2..3] = 01. 
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: - t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        print(s[::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input, and every second character of the string `s` is printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It iterates `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration, it takes an integer input `n`, a string input `s`, and prints every second character of the string `s`. The functionality of the function is not specified beyond these actions, and there are no constraints or relationships provided for any input parameters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. s is a binary string of length 2n-1 consisting of characters 0 or 1.**
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers generated by splitting the input binary string 's' and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input binary string 's' from the user, splits it, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of those integers. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. s is a binary string of length 2n-1 where each character is either 0 or 1.**
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the result of adding 'o' to the integer value of each element 'x' obtained by splitting the input string. The input string 's' is a binary string of length 2n-1 and 'o' is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the output list is the result of adding `o` to the integer value of each element `x` obtained by splitting the input string. The input string `s` is expected to be a binary string of length 2n-1, where each character is either 0 or 1. The function does not directly use the parameter `s` provided in the precondition, instead, it reads input from the user's input(). Therefore, the functionality of the function involves reading input from the user, splitting it, converting the elements to integers, adding `o` to each integer, and returning a list of these modified integers. The function does not directly operate on the input binary string `s` as stated in the precondition.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. s is a binary string of length 2n-1.**
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing the result of calling func_2() n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and there is a binary string `m` of length 2n-1. The function returns a list containing the result of calling `func_2()` n times.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values generated by calling function `func_5` with arguments `f` and the remaining elements of the `dim` list (excluding the first element) for each iteration in the range of the first element of `dim`. If `dim` is empty, then the program returns the result of calling function `f`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 accepts a function f and a list dim. It then returns a list of values generated by recursively calling func_5 with arguments f and the remaining elements of dim (excluding the first element) for each iteration in the range specified by the first element of dim. If dim is empty, the function returns the result of calling function f.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
