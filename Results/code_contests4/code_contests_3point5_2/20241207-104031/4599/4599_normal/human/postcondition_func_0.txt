The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It iterates `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration, it takes an integer input `n`, a string input `s`, and prints every second character of the string `s`. The functionality of the function is not specified beyond these actions, and there are no constraints or relationships provided for any input parameters.
