def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input, and every second character of the string `s` is printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It iterates `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration, it takes an integer input `n`, a string input `s`, and prints every second character of the string `s`. The functionality of the function is not specified beyond these actions, and there are no constraints or relationships provided for any input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. s is a binary string of length 2n-1 consisting of characters 0 or 1.**
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers generated by splitting the input binary string 's' and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input binary string 's' from the user, splits it, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of those integers. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. s is a binary string of length 2n-1 where each character is either 0 or 1.**
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the result of adding 'o' to the integer value of each element 'x' obtained by splitting the input string. The input string 's' is a binary string of length 2n-1 and 'o' is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the output list is the result of adding `o` to the integer value of each element `x` obtained by splitting the input string. The input string `s` is expected to be a binary string of length 2n-1, where each character is either 0 or 1. The function does not directly use the parameter `s` provided in the precondition, instead, it reads input from the user's input(). Therefore, the functionality of the function involves reading input from the user, splitting it, converting the elements to integers, adding `o` to each integer, and returning a list of these modified integers. The function does not directly operate on the input binary string `s` as stated in the precondition.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. s is a binary string of length 2n-1.**
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing the result of calling func_2() n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and there is a binary string `m` of length 2n-1. The function returns a list containing the result of calling `func_2()` n times.

def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of values generated by calling function `func_5` with arguments `f` and the remaining elements of the `dim` list (excluding the first element) for each iteration in the range of the first element of `dim`. If `dim` is empty, then the program returns the result of calling function `f`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_5 accepts a function f and a list dim. It then returns a list of values generated by recursively calling func_5 with arguments f and the remaining elements of dim (excluding the first element) for each iteration in the range specified by the first element of dim. If dim is empty, the function returns the result of calling function f.
