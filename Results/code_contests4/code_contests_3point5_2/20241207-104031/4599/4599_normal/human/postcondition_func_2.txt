The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the output list is the result of adding `o` to the integer value of each element `x` obtained by splitting the input string. The input string `s` is expected to be a binary string of length 2n-1, where each character is either 0 or 1. The function does not directly use the parameter `s` provided in the precondition, instead, it reads input from the user's input(). Therefore, the functionality of the function involves reading input from the user, splitting it, converting the elements to integers, adding `o` to each integer, and returning a list of these modified integers. The function does not directly operate on the input binary string `s` as stated in the precondition.
