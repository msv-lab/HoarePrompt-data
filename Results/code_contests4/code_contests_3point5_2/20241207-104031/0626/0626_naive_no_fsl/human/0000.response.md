Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads the input, constructs the tree, calculates the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced, and then prints the result. The logic in the code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description provided. The program recursively calculates the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the subtree weights and determines the maximum number of apples to remove based on the LCM. The implementation seems to handle the given problem correctly for all cases.
