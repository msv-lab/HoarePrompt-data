Functionality: **The function func_9 accepts a parameter `node`, where n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, ai is an integer between 0 and 10^8, and xi, yi are integers between 1 and n (xi != yi). However, the function does not perform any operations as indicated in the annotations, returning nothing. The code does not execute any logic beyond the initial if statement check.**
