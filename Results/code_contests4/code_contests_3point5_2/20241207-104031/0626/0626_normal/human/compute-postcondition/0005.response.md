According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in node[2]. If node[2] has at least 1 child, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the initial state of node[1] being less than 0, lcm being 1, and max being -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted. 
State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi, for the loop to execute the first time node[2] has at least 1 child, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is 1, max is -1**
