Example Answer:
`max` is assigned the value of `t`, where `t` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `max` and `t`. Therefore, after execution, `max` will have the same value as `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`lcm` is updated, `max` is the same as `t`, `child` is updated, `t` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `max` and `t`**
