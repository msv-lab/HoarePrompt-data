Example Answer:
The function `func_9` is called with the parameter `child`. The impact of this call depends on the implementation of the function and the value of `child`, which is not provided in the initial state. Since the specific details are unknown, we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **Unknown, as the specific details of the function implementation and the value of `child` are not provided.**
