Output State: **`lcm` is updated by calling func_7 with parameters `lcm` and the last child in node[2], `max` is the maximum value of `t` calculated in each iteration of the loop, `child` is the last child in node[2], `t` is the result of dividing the second element of `child` by `lcm` and then multiplying by `lcm`, `node[0]` is now equal to `lcm`, `node[1]` is assigned the value of `max` multiplied by the length of `node[2]`**
