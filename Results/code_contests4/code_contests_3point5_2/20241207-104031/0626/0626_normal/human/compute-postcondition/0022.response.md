Example Answer:
The value of `max` is assigned the value of `t`. The previous values of `lcm`, `max`, and `child` are updated, and `t` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `max` and `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `lcm` is updated, `max` is updated to the calculated value of `t`, `child` is updated, `t` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `max` and `t`.
Output State: **`lcm` is updated, `max` is updated to the calculated value of `t`, `child` is updated, `t` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `max` and `t`**
