Example Answer:
lcm is updated by calling func_7 with parameters lcm and child[0]. The value of lcm is updated based on the return value of func_7. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi, for the loop to execute the second time node[2] has at least 2 children, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is updated by calling func_7 with parameters lcm and child[1], max is -1**
