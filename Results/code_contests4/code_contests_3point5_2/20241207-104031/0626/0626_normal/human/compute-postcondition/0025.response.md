Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of `child[1] / lcm * lcm`. The values of `lcm`, `max`, and `child` are updated based on specific conditions. The output state is: `lcm` is updated, `max` is assigned the value of `t`, `child` is updated, `t` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `max` and `t`.
Output State: **`lcm` is updated, `max` is assigned the value of `t`, `child` is updated, `t` is calculated based on specific conditions involving `max` and `t`**
