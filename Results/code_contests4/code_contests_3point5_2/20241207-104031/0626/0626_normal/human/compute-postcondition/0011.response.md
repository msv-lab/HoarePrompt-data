According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable node[2]. If node[2] has at least 2 children, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi, node[2] has at least 2 children, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is updated by calling func_7 with parameters lcm and child[1], max is -1. So for the loop to execute one more time, node[2] must have at least 3 children.
State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi, for the loop to execute the third time node[2] has at least 3 children, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is updated by calling func_7 with parameters lcm and child[1], max is -1**
