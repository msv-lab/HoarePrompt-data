Example Answer:
The function `func_7` is called with arguments `lcm` and `child[0]`. The specific details of the function implementation and the value of `child` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact impact on the program. The output state will depend on how `func_7` modifies the values of `lcm` and `child[0]`.
Output State: **Unknown, as the specific details of the function implementation and the value of `child` are not provided.**
