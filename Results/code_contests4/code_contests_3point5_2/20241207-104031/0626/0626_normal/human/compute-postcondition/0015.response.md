According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in node[2]. Therefore, for the loop to execute, node[2] must not be empty. Additionally, the variables that need to be adjusted are `child`, `lcm`, and `max`. For the loop to execute the first time, `lcm` should be updated by calling func_7 with parameters `lcm` and the last child in node[2], `max` should be -1, and `child` should be the first child in node[2].

State: **`lcm` is updated by calling func_7 with parameters `lcm` and the last child in node[2], `max` is -1, for the loop to execute the first time `child` is the first child in node[2], node[2] is not empty**
