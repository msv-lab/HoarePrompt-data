Example Answer:
The function func_9 is called with the parameter child. The impact of this function call on the program depends on the implementation of func_9 and the value of the parameter child. Without further information, we cannot determine the exact impact on the variables in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8, xi and yi are integers such that 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi != yi, for the loop to execute the second time node[2] has at least 2 children, node[1] is less than 0, lcm is updated by calling func_7 with parameters lcm and child[1], max is -1.
