Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input, constructs the tree structure, calculates the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced, and updates the tree nodes accordingly. The functions are designed to handle the tree structure and perform the necessary calculations as described in the problem.

The program iterates through the tree nodes, calculates the least common multiple (lcm) of the subtree weights, and then updates the node values based on this calculation. It ensures that the tree becomes balanced by adjusting the number of apples in the nodes as needed.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
