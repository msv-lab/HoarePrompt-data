Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, the program appears to correctly handle the task of counting the minimum number of apples that need to be removed to make the tree balanced. The code defines functions to handle input, perform calculations, and traverse the tree structure to determine the necessary removal of apples. The logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem description, as it calculates the weight of subtrees, checks for balanced conditions, and removes apples accordingly. Additionally, the code seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring the correctness of the solution. Therefore, based on the code structure and the problem requirements, the program is correct.
