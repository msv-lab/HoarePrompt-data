The function `func_5` accepts a parameter `o`, which is a tuple consisting of an integer `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the number of apples in each vertex of the tree, and then followed by `n-1` tuples of two integers representing the edges in the tree. The function simply prints the input tuple `o` and does not have any specific return value mentioned.
