The function `func_8` traverses a rooted tree structure represented by nodes and parents. It iterates through the children of a node, and if a child is not the parent node, it recursively calls itself on that child. If a child is the parent node, it removes that child from the list of children. The function does not return any specific value, and the postconditions do not provide information on what happens if ii is negative, potentially missing a condition where ii is negative.
