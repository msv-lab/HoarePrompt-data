n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The list of integers a1, a2, ..., an contains n elements where each element ai is an integer such that 0 <= ai <= 10^8. The input represents a rooted tree with n vertices and each non-leaf vertex has zero apples. The tree edges are described by n - 1 pairs of integers xi, yi where 1 <= xi, yi <= n and xi â‰  yi. Vertex 1 is the root of the tree.**
