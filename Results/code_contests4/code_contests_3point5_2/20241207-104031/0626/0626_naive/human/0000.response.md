Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It constructs a tree data structure based on the input.
- It recursively calculates the minimum number of apples that need to be removed to balance the tree.
- The logic seems to correctly identify the minimum number of apples to remove in order to make the tree balanced.
- The program handles the case where all apples need to be removed to balance the tree.
- The program seems to cover all the requirements mentioned in the problem description.
