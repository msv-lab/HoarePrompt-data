Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for positive integers A_1,...,A_N that satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description. The program follows the constraints provided and calculates the answer modulo (10^9 +7). The program loops through each integer in the input array, calculates the prime factors of each integer, determines the maximum count for each prime factor, calculates the least common multiple (lcm) of all prime factors, and then computes the final answer by multiplying the lcm with the modular inverse of each element in the input array. The program handles all potential cases and produces the correct output.
