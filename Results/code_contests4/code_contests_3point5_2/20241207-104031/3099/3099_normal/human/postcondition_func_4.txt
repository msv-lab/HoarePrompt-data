The function `func_5` accepts a list `a` of N positive integers and a positive integer `m`, where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= m <= 10^6. The function performs calculations on `a` and `m` to determine the final value of variable `x` following a series of operations involving `m`, `a`, `x`, and `y`. If the execution reaches a specific condition where `m` is equal to 1, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the final value of `x` based on the given conditions and returns it. In the process, if `x` becomes negative, it is adjusted by adding `m0`.
