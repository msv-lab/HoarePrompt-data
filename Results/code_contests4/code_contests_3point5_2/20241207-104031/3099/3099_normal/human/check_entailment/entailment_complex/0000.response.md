Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The `func_6` function does not correctly calculate the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for the given input values A_1, ..., A_N. The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the prime factors of the input integers, which is not equivalent to the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N as required by the problem description. The function then multiplies the LCM with the result of two other functions, `func_2` and `func_4`, which further deviates from the problem requirements.

Therefore, based on the discrepancy between the code logic and the problem description, the correctness of the code is **False**.
