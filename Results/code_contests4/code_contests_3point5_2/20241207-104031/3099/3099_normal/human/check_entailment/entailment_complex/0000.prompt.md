You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are N positive integers A_1,...,A_N.

Consider positive integers B_1, ..., B_N that satisfy the following condition.

Condition: For any i, j such that 1 \leq i < j \leq N, A_i B_i = A_j B_j holds.

Find the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for such B_1,...,B_N.

Since the answer can be enormous, print the sum modulo (10^9 +7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^4
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

A_1 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N for B_1,...,B_N that satisfy the condition, modulo (10^9 +7).

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`c` is the sum of `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, the program executes as follows: if `c` is equal to `mod`, `c` is updated to `mod`. If `c` is greater than `mod`, `c` remains unchanged.
    return c
    #The program returns the updated value of 'c' after the conditions are applied
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and then updates the value of `c` based on the condition that if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it is adjusted accordingly. The function returns the final value of `c` after applying the conditions. If `c` equals `mod`, it is set to `mod`, and if `c` exceeds `mod`, it remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of the multiplication of 'a' and 'b' modulo 'mod'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the result of their multiplication modulo `mod`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    else :
        if (b % 2 == 1) :
            return func_2(a, func_3(a, b - 1))
            #The program returns the result of calling func_2 with parameters a and the result of calling func_3 with parameters a and b-1.
        else :
            temp = func_3(a, b / 2)
            return func_2(temp, temp)
            #The program returns the result of calling func_2 with the input parameters 'temp' and 'temp'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns different values based on the following cases:
Case 1: If `b` is equal to 0, the function returns the integer 1.
Case 2: If `b` is odd, the function calls `func_2` with parameters `a` and the result of calling `func_3` with parameters `a` and `b-1`.
Case 3: If `b` is even, the function calculates `temp` by calling `func_3` with parameters `a` and `b / 2`, then returns the result of calling `func_2` with `temp` as both parameters.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` involves recursion and condition checking based on the value of `b`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4(a):
    return func_3(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of calling function 'func_3' with arguments 'a' and 'mod - 2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 accepts a parameter `a` and returns the result of calling function 'func_3' with arguments 'a' and 'mod - 2'.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of N positive integers and m is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= m <= 10^6.
def func_5(a, m):
    m0 = m
    y = 0
    x = 1
    if (m == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a list of N positive integers, `m`, `m0` are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= m <= 10^6, `m0` is the same as `m`, `y` is 0, `x` is 1, m is not equal to 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        
        t = m
        
        m = a % m
        
        a = t
        
        t = y
        
        y = x - q * y
        
        x = t
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 1, `m` is 0, `m0` and `t` are positive integers, `y` is the result of the final `x - q * y`, `x` is the result of the final `y`
    if (x < 0) :
        x = x + m0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is 1, `m` is 0, `m0` and `t` are positive integers, `y` is the result of the final `x - q * y`, `x` is the result of the final `y`. If `x` is less than 0, then `x` is increased by `m0`.
    return x
    #The program returns the final value of variable `x` after the calculations described above
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `a` of N positive integers and a positive integer `m`, where 1 <= N <= 10^4 and 1 <= m <= 10^6. The function performs calculations on `a` and `m` to determine the final value of variable `x` following a series of operations involving `m`, `a`, `x`, and `y`. If the execution reaches a specific condition where `m` is equal to 1, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the final value of `x` based on the given conditions and returns it. In the process, if `x` becomes negative, it is adjusted by adding `m0`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    answer = {}
    for i in range(n):
        cnt = {}
        
        x = arr[i]
        
        i = 2
        
        while i * i <= x:
            while x % i == 0:
                x /= i
                cnt[i] = cnt.get(i, 0) + 1
            i += 1
        
        if x != 1:
            cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        for key in cnt:
            answer[key] = max(answer.get(key, 0), cnt[key])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary where each key corresponds to a prime factor of the integers in `arr` and the value is the maximum power of that prime factor that divides the integer at its index in `arr`
    lcm = 1
    for prime in answer:
        for _ in range(answer[prime]):
            lcm = func_2(lcm, prime)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and each prime factor in the `answer` dictionary
    ans = 0
    for x in arr:
        ans = func_1(ans, func_2(lcm, func_4(x)))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer, `lcm` is updated, `ans` is the result of multiple calls to `func_1` with arguments `ans`, the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and the result of calling `func_4` with each element in `arr`
    ans = int(ans)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers. It then calculates the prime factors of each integer in the list and stores the maximum power of each prime factor in a dictionary `answer`. After that, it computes the least common multiple (lcm) of these prime factors. Next, it iterates through the list of integers, calculates the product of the lcm with the result of two different functions, and updates the answer. Finally, it converts the final answer to an integer and prints it. The function does not accept any parameters and solely operates based on the input read during execution.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
