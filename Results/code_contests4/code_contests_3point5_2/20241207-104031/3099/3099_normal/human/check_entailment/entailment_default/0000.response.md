Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers.
- It calculates the prime factors of each integer in the list and stores the maximum power of each prime factor in a dictionary `answer`.
- It then computes the least common multiple (lcm) of these prime factors.
- Next, it iterates through the list of integers, calculates the product of the lcm with the result of two different functions, and updates the answer.
- Finally, it converts the final answer to an integer and prints it.

The code seems to follow the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum possible value of `B_1 + ... + B_N` for `B_1,...,B_N` that satisfy the condition, modulo `(10^9 +7)`. The functions are structured to handle the prime factors and lcm calculations effectively. There are no apparent edge cases where the code might fail to meet the requirements.
