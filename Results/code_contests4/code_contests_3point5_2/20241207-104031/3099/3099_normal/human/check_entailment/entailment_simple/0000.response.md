Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. It calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N satisfying the condition provided, and prints the result modulo (10^9 + 7). The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description and follows the necessary steps to calculate the required value. Each function in the program contributes to the overall correctness of the solution, ensuring that the final output meets the requirements of the problem. The program goes through each integer in the input list, calculates the prime factors and their powers, determines the least common multiple (LCM), and calculates the final result by applying the required operations.

Therefore, the program is correct and provides the expected output for all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
