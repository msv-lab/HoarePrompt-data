According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `answer[prime]`. If `answer[prime]` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `answer[prime]` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `answer[prime]` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with at least one key `prime1` where the value is greater than or equal to 1, `lcm` is updated with the result of `func_2(lcm, prime)`, for the loop to execute the third time `answer[prime]` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1**
