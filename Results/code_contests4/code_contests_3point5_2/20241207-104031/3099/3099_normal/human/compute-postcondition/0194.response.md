Functionality: ** The function `func_6` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers. It then calculates the prime factors of each integer in the list and stores the maximum power of each prime factor in a dictionary `answer`. After that, it computes the least common multiple (lcm) of these prime factors. Next, it iterates through the list of integers, calculates the product of the lcm with the result of two different functions, and updates the answer. Finally, it converts the final answer to an integer and prints it. The function does not accept any parameters and solely operates based on the input read during execution. **
