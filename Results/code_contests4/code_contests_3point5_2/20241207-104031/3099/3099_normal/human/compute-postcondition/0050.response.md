Example Answer:
The code snippet adds a new key-value pair to the `answer` dictionary. The value for the key is set to the maximum value between the current value of the key in `answer` dictionary and the value of the key in the `cnt` dictionary. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` dictionary has a new key-value pair added, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key, `x` is updated to a new value, `key` is the next key in the dictionary `cnt`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` dictionary has a new key-value pair added, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key, `x` is updated to a new value, `key` is the next key in the dictionary `cnt`**
