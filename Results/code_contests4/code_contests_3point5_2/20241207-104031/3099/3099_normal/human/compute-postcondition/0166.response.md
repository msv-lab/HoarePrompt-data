According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are keys in the `answer` dictionary. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with at least one key `prime1` where the value is greater than or equal to 1, and `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
- The key `prime1` should be processed in the loop body.
- Any necessary updates to `n`, `arr`, `answer`, and `lcm` based on the processing of `prime1` should be made.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with at least one key `prime1` where the value is greater than or equal to 1, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary for the next iteration**
