`lcm` is assigned the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime`. The value of `lcm` will be updated based on the return value of `func_2`. If the condition mentioned in the initial state is met, the loop will execute one more time. 
Output State: **output state, for the loop to execute one more time the value stored in the answer list at index 1 must be greater than 0**
