According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0
- `arr` is a list containing integers with at least 1 integer
- `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer
- `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and each prime factor in the `answer` dictionary
- `ans` is 0

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers with at least 1 integer, `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and each prime factor in the `answer` dictionary, `ans` is 0**
