According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is set to 2 and `x` is set to the value of `arr[i]`. This means `i * i` should be less than or equal to `arr[i]` for the loop to execute the first time. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with the maximum values from `cnt`, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is set to the value of `arr[i]`, `i` is set to 2 for the loop to execute the first time `i * i` should be less than or equal to `x`**
