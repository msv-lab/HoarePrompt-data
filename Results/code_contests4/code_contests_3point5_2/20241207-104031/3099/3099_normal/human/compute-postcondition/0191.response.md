Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the integer value of `ans`. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer, `lcm` is updated, `ans` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer, `lcm` is updated, `ans` is an integer**
