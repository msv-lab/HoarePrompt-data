According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answer` dictionary and the value associated with the key `prime`. If the value is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the value associated with the key `prime` is greater than or equal to 1, and `_` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with more keys to iterate over, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time the value associated with the key `prime` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0**
