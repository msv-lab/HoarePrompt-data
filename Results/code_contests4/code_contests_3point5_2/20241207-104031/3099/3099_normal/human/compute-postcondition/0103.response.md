Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the `answer` dictionary by taking the maximum value between the current value in `answer` for a specific `key` and the corresponding value in the `cnt` dictionary for the same `key`. If there is no value for that `key` in `answer`, it defaults to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` dictionary is updated with maximum values, `i` such that i*i is greater than `x`, `cnt` has at least two more keys to iterate over, `x` is the final value after dividing by the highest powers of all prime factors that divide it.
