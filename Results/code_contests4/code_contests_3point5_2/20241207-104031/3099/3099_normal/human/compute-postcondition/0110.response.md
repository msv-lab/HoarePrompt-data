According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x % i` is equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is set to the value of `arr[i]` and `i` is set to 2. For the loop to execute the first time, `i * i` should be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be such that `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `x` should be divisible by `i`, i.e., `x % i` should be equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with the maximum values from `cnt`, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is set to the value of `arr[i]`, `i` is set to 2 for the loop to execute the first time `i * i` should be less than or equal to `x`**
