Example Answer:
The code snippet `answer[key] = max(answer.get(key, 0), cnt[key])` updates the value of the key in the `answer` dictionary with the maximum value between the current value of the key in `answer` and the value of the key in `cnt`. The variables `key`, `answer`, and `cnt` are affected by this operation. The initial state of `answer` is a dictionary with updated maximum values from `cnt`, so the operation updates the values in the `answer` dictionary accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with updated maximum values from `cnt`, `x` is 1, `i` is the smallest prime factor of the original `x`, `i` is equal to the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, `cnt` has at least one more key, and `i` is a key in `cnt` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with updated maximum values from `cnt`, `x` is 1, `i` is the smallest prime factor of the original `x`, `i` is equal to the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, `cnt` has at least one more key, and `i` is a key in `cnt` for the loop to execute one more time**
