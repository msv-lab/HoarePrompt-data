According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary, `i` is 2, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is updated to a new value at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by the highest power of the prime factor that divides it.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased so that `i * i` is still less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, if the value of `x` is updated within the loop, it should be recalculated here to ensure the loop condition is met.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary, `i` is increased from 2, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is recalculated or updated to new value at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by the highest power of the prime factor that divides it**
