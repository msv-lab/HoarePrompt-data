Example Answer: 
`func_4(x)` returns a value which is then used as an argument in `func_2(lcm, result_of_func_4)`. The result of `func_2()` is then passed as an argument in `func_1()`, which updates the value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers with at least 2 integers, `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer, `lcm` is updated, `ans` is updated.
