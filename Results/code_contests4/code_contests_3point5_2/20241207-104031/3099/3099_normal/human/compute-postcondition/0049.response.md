According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `key` and `cnt`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair added, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key, `x` is updated to a new value, `key` is the first key in the dictionary `cnt`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the key must be the next key in the dictionary `cnt`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair added, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key, `x` is updated to a new value, `key` is the next key in the dictionary `cnt`**
