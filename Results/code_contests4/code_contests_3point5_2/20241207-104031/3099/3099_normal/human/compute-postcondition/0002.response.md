Example Answer:
Since `answer` is initialized as an empty dictionary, no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list containing the input integers; `answer` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list containing the input integers; `answer` is an empty dictionary**
