According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `cnt`. If `cnt` has more keys to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` dictionary has a new key-value pair added, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key, `x` is updated to a new value, `key` is the next key in the dictionary `cnt`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more keys left in the `cnt` dictionary.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` dictionary has a new key-value pair added, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key, `x` is updated to a new value, `key` is the next key in the dictionary `cnt` and there are more keys left in the dictionary `cnt`**
