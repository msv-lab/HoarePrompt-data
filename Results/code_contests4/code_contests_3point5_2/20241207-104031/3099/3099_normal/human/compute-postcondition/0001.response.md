Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list `arr` by taking input from the user, converting each element to an integer, and splitting the input based on spaces. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as an input integer and not the actual input values, the final state will consist of the list `arr` containing the input integers provided by the user.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list containing the input integers**
