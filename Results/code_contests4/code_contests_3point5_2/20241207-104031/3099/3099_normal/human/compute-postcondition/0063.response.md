Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary, `i` is increased from 2, `cnt` is a dictionary with key `i` initialized to 1 if it exists or 0 if it doesn't, `x` at index 2 in the list `arr` is recalculated or updated to a new value divided by the highest power of the prime factor that divides it and for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must remain divisible by the new value of `i`, `x` is divided by `i`**
