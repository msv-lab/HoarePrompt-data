Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with updated maximum values from `cnt`, `x` is 1, `i` is the smallest prime factor of the original `x`, `i` is equal to the square root of the original `x`, if `x` is not equal to 1, then `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, `cnt` has at least one more key left to iterate, `i` is a key in `cnt` for the loop to execute one more time, and `answer[key]` is updated with the maximum value between the current value in `answer` for key and the value of `cnt[key]`.**
