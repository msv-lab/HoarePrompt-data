Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with the maximum values from `cnt`, `cnt` contains the prime factors of `x` as keys with their respective counts as values, `x` is the result of dividing the original `x` by `i`, `i` is the next prime factor of the original `x` incremented by 1, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[i]` is further incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, `x % i == 0`, `cnt[i]` is further incremented by 1, `cnt[i]` is updated with the value of `cnt.get(i, 0) + 1`**
