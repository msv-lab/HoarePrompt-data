According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `answer[prime]`. If the value is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `answer[prime]` is greater than or equal to 1. Also, for the loop to execute the first time, `lcm` needs to be updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary, and the loop index `_` needs to be 0.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with at least one key `prime1` where the value is greater than or equal to 1, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `answer[prime]` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 0**
