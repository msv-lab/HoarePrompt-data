According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `answer` is an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing the input integers, `answer` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
