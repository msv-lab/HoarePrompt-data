According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in the `answer` dictionary. If the dictionary has more keys to iterate over, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with at least one key `prime1` where the value is greater than or equal to 1, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more keys in the `answer` dictionary to iterate over.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with more keys to iterate over, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary**
