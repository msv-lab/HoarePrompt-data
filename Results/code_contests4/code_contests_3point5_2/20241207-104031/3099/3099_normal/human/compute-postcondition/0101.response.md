Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the values in the `answer` dictionary based on the maximum value between the existing value for a key and `cnt[key]`. If there is no existing value for a key, it takes 0 as the default value. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` dictionary is updated with maximum values, `i` such that i*i is greater than `x`, `cnt` has at least one more key to iterate over, `x` is the final value after dividing by the highest powers of all prime factors that divide it.
