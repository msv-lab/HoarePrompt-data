Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key represents a prime factor of the integers in `arr` and the corresponding value is the maximum power of that prime factor that divides the integer at its index in `arr`, `x` is updated to the new value at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by the highest power of the prime factor that divides it. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 1***
