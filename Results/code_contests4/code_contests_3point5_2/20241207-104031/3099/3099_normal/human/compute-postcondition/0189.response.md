The function `func_4(x)` is called with the parameter `x`, and the result is passed to `func_2` along with the current value of `lcm`. The output of `func_2` is then passed as a parameter to `func_1` along with the current value of `ans`. The updated values of `lcm` and `ans` are not directly provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers with at least 3 integers, `answer` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to prime factors of integers in `arr` and the maximum powers that divide each integer, `lcm` is updated, `ans` is updated.
