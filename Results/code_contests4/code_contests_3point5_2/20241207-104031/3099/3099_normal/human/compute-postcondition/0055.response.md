Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary where each key corresponds to a prime factor of the integers in `arr` and the value is the maximum power of that prime factor that divides the integer at its index in `arr`, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the maximum integer in `arr`, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is updated to the new value at index 2 in the list `arr` divided by the highest power of the prime factor that divides it, `answer` contains the maximum power of each prime factor found in `cnt` after iterating through all keys in `cnt`**
