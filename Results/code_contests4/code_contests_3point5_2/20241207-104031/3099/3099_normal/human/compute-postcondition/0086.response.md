According to the code, the loop can execute again if `x` is divisible by `i + 8`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 8, so `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 8`. Additionally, since `x` needs to be divisible by `i + 8`, `x` needs to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary, `i` is increased by 8, `cnt` is a dictionary with keys representing the prime factors of `x` at index 2 in the list `arr` and their corresponding highest powers that divide `x`, `x` at index 2 in the list `arr` is recalculated or updated to the final value after dividing by the highest powers of all prime factors that divide it, `x` is recalculated accordingly, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 8` and `x` must be divisible by `i + 8`**
