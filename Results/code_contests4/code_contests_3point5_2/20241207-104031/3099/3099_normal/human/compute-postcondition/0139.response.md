Example Answer:
The code snippet increments the count of the key `i` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. If `i` is not present in `cnt`, it initializes its count to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with the maximum values from `cnt`, `cnt` contains the prime factors of the original `x` as keys with their respective counts as values, for the loop to execute again `x` is adjusted to a value where `i * i` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is adjusted accordingly, `x` is divided by `i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with the maximum values from `cnt`, `cnt` contains the prime factors of the original `x` as keys with their respective counts as values, for the loop to execute again `x` is adjusted to a value where `i * i` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is adjusted accordingly, `x` is divided by `i`.**
