According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with maximum values from `cnt`, `cnt` contains key `i` with a value of either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[i] + 1`, `x` is the result of dividing `x` by `i`, `i` is updated to the next value where `(i+1) * (i+1)` is less than or equal to the updated `x`, and `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` should be divisible by the updated value of `i`
- `i` should be updated to the next value where `(i+1) * (i+1)` is less than or equal to the updated `x`

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `answer` is a dictionary with the maximum values from `cnt`, `cnt` contains key `i` with a value of either 1 or the previous value of `cnt[i] + 1`, `x` is the result of dividing `x` by `i`, `i` is updated to the next value where `(i+1) * (i+1)` is less than or equal to the updated `x`, `cnt[i]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `x` should be divisible by the updated value of `i` and `i` should be updated to the next value where `(i+1) * (i+1)` is less than or equal to the updated `x`**.
