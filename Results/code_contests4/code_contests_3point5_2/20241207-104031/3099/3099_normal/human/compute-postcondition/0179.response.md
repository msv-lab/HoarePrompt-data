According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value associated with the key `prime` in the `answer` dictionary. If the value associated with the key `prime` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with more keys to iterate over, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary where the loop executes the second time, and `_` is 0.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value associated with the key `prime` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list containing integers, `answer` is a dictionary with more keys to iterate over, `lcm` is updated by calling `func_2` with arguments `lcm` and `prime` for each value of `prime` in the `answer` dictionary where the loop executes the third time the value associated with the key `prime` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
