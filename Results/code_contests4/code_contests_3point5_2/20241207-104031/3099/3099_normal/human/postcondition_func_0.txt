The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the sum of `a` and `b`, and then updates the value of `c` based on the condition that if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it is adjusted accordingly. The function returns the final value of `c` after applying the conditions. If `c` equals `mod`, it is set to `mod`, and if `c` exceeds `mod`, it remains unchanged.
