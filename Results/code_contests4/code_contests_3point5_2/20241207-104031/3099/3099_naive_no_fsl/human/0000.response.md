Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for N and the array of positive integers A.
2. It then calculates the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N as per the given condition and prints the result modulo (10^9 + 7).
3. The functions defined in the program handle the arithmetic operations and calculations required to find the minimum value of B_1 + ... + B_N.
4. The program iterates through the array of positive integers A, calculates the prime factors, determines the maximum occurrence of each prime factor, calculates the least common multiple (lcm), and finally computes the minimum possible value of B_1 + ... + B_N.
5. The program follows the problem description and constraints provided.
