Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x for all potential cases. For example, if we input x = 1, the program will output 1, when in fact Jack requires 3 jumps to reach x = 1 (jump 1 unit to the right, then jump 2 units to the left, then jump 3 units to the right). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
