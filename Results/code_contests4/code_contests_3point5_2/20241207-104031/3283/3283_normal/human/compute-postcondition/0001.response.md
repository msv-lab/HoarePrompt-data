Example Answer:
The value of `d` is assigned the result of the expression `int(ceil((sqrt(1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2))`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so the value inside the `sqrt` function will always be greater than 1, resulting in a positive value. The `sqrt` function will return the square root of that value, which will also be positive. The `ceil` function will round that value up to the nearest integer. Finally, dividing by 2 and taking the integer part will give the final value of `d`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is a positive integer, `d` is an integer.
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is a positive integer, `d` is an integer**
