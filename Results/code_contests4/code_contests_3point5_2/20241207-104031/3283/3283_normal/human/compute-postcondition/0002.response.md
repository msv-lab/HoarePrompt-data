Example Answer:
The code accesses the value at index `[n % 2][d % 4]` in the given nested list `[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]]` and adds the value of `d` to it. The values of `n` and `d` are used to determine the indices to access in the list. 
Given the initial state where `x` is an integer, `-109 <= x <= 109`, `n` is a positive integer, and `d` is an integer, the calculation `[[0, 2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 2]][n % 2][d % 4] + d` will result in a new integer value.
Output State: **A new integer value based on the calculation**
