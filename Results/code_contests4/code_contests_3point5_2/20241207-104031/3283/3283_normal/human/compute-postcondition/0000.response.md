Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the absolute value of the input, which means `n` will always be positive. The input is taken as a string, so the absolute function will convert it to an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that -109 <= x <= 109, `n` is a positive integer**
