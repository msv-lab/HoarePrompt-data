Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program description states that Jack can go either left or right with each jump, but the code does not take into account the direction of the jumps. Additionally, the output hints do not provide any edge cases that the code might not be handling, so we cannot rely on them to confirm the correctness of the code. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
