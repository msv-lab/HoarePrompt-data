Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal number of jumps that Jack requires to reach x based on the problem description. It first calculates the absolute value of the input x, then uses a formula to determine the number of jumps needed. The program then uses a matrix lookup to get the correct number of jumps before printing the result.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
