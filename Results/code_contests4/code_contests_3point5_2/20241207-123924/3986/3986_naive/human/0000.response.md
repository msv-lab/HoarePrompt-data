Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped based on the given areas of its three faces. It uses the formula provided in the problem description to calculate the lengths of the edges and then sums them up. The logic seems correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
