Correctness: False

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it does not calculate the sum of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped as required by the problem description. The program calculates the sum of the lengths of the edges of the parallelepiped by finding the square roots of the ratios of the areas of the faces. This approach does not guarantee that the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges will be correct for all possible parallelepipeds. For example, for the input 4 6 6, the program outputs 24 instead of the correct answer of 28.
