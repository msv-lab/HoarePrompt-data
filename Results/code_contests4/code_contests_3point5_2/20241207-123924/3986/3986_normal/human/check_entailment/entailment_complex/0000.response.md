Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads three space-separated integers representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. It then calculates the square roots of the products of pairs of these areas and prints the sum of these square roots multiplied by 4. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped. The program ensures that the input areas are positive and do not exceed 10^4.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
