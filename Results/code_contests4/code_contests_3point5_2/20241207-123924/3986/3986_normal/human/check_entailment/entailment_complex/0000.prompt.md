You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.

Input

The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive ( > 0) and do not exceed 104. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.

Output

Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.

Examples

Input

1 1 1


Output

12


Input

4 6 6


Output

28

Note

In the first sample the parallelepiped has sizes 1 × 1 × 1, in the second one — 2 × 2 × 3.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three space-separated integers representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. The area's values are positive (>0) and do not exceed 10^4.**
def func():
    a, b, c = map(float, raw_input().split())
    x = (a / b * c) ** 0.5
    y = (b / c * a) ** 0.5
    z = (c / a * b) ** 0.5
    print(4 * (x + y + z))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three space-separated integers representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped, calculates the square roots of the products of pairs of these areas, and then prints the sum of these square roots multiplied by 4. The function assumes the input areas are positive (>0) and do not exceed 10^4.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
