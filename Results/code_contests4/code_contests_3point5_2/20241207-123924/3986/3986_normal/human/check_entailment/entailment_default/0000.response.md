Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly reads three space-separated integers representing the areas of the three faces of a rectangular parallelepiped. It then calculates the square roots of the products of pairs of these areas and prints the sum of these square roots multiplied by 4. The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it accurately calculates the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped based on the given input areas. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code is functioning as expected and handles the input areas within the specified constraints.
