Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program is supposed to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of the parallelepiped, but the program only calculates and prints 4 times the sum of the square roots of the ratios of the areas of the faces.

Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()` function which is not a valid function in Python 3. Instead, `input()` function should be used to take input from the user.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct output.
