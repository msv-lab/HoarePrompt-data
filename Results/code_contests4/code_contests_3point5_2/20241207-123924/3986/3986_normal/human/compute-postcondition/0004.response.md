Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` after performing the square root operations on the given expressions. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated using the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. After that, the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is multiplied by 4 and printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x`, `y`, and `z` are the square roots of the respective expressions; and the result of `4 * (x + y + z)` is printed.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x`, `y`, and `z` are the square roots of the respective expressions; and the result of `4 * (x + y + z)` is printed**
