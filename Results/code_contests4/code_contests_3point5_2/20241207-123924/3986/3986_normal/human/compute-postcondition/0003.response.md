Example Answer:
`z` is assigned the value of the square root of `(c / a * b)`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped, `x` is the square root of `(a / b * c)` and `y` is the square root of `(b / c * a)`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x` is the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`, `y` is the square root of the result of `(b / c * a)`, `z` is the square root of `(c / a * b)`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x` is the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`, `y` is the square root of the result of `(b / c * a)`, `z` is the square root of `(c / a * b)**`.
