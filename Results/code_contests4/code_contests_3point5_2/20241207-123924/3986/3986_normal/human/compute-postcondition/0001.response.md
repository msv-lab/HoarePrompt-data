Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x` is the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x` is the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`**
