Example Answer:
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the floating-point values obtained by splitting the input by spaces. The areas of the three faces of the parallelepiped are represented by these variables. The values are positive and do not exceed 10^4. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped**
