Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value of `(b / c * a) ** 0.5`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped. The value of `x` is the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are given, so we can calculate `x` directly. After execution, the values of `y` and `x` are determined based on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x` is the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`, `y` is the square root of the result of `(b / c * a)`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the areas of the three faces of the rectangular parallelepiped; `x` is the square root of the result of `(a / b * c)`, `y` is the square root of the result of `(b / c * a)`**
