Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained by adding the given integers. It iterates through the list of integers, calculates the sum of all integers, and then checks if the sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it subtracts the minimum odd integer from the sum to make it even. Finally, it prints the maximum possible even sum.

The program follows the problem description as it calculates the maximum even sum possible by using some of the given integers.
