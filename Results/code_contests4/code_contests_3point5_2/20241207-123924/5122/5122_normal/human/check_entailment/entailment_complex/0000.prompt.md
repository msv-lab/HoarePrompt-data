You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today, Wet Shark is given n integers. Using any of these integers no more than once, Wet Shark wants to get maximum possible even (divisible by 2) sum. Please, calculate this value for Wet Shark. 

Note, that if Wet Shark uses no integers from the n integers, the sum is an even integer 0.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). The next line contains n space separated integers given to Wet Shark. Each of these integers is in range from 1 to 109, inclusive. 

Output

Print the maximum possible even sum that can be obtained if we use some of the given integers. 

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

6

Input

5
999999999 999999999 999999999 999999999 999999999


Output

3999999996

Note

In the first sample, we can simply take all three integers for a total sum of 6.

In the second sample Wet Shark should take any four out of five integers 999 999 999.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and the list of n integers contains values between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    vs = map(int, raw_input().split())
    minO = -1
    res = 0
    for e in vs:
        res += e
        
        if minO == -1 or minO > e:
            minO = e
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a positive integer, vs contains n elements, minO is the minimum value in vs, res is the sum of all elements in vs
    if (res % 2 == 1) :
        res -= minO
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, vs contains n elements, minO is the minimum value in vs, res is the sum of all elements in vs. If the sum of all elements in vs is still an odd number after subtracting minO, then the program will execute the if block. Otherwise, the program will not enter the if block.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an input n and a list of n integers. It calculates the sum of all integers in the list and finds the minimum value in the list. If the sum of all integers is odd, it subtracts the minimum value from the sum and prints the result. The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
