Example Answer:
`res` is initialized to 0. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, list `vs` contains n integers between 1 and 10^9, minO is -1, res is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, list `vs` contains n integers between 1 and 10^9, minO is -1, res is 0**
