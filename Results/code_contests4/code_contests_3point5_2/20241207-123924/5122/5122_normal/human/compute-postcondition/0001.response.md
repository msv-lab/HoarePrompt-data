Example Answer:
`vs` is assigned the values obtained by converting the input values to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input values are split by spaces and converted to integers. The previous state of variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, list `vs` contains n integers between 1 and 10^9.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, list `vs` contains n integers between 1 and 10^9**
