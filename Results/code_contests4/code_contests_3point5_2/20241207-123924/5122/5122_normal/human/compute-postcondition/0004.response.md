According to the code, the loop can execute for each element e in the list vs. Since n is a positive integer, vs must contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute. The initial values of minO and res are not relevant to the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: vs contains at least 1 element, and e is the first element in vs.
State: **n is a positive integer, vs contains at least 1 element, e is the first element in vs, minO is -1, res is 0**
