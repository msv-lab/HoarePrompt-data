Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated by adding the value of `e`. The previous values of `res` and `e` are unknown, so the updated `res` will be the sum of the previous `res` and `e`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, vs contains at least 2 elements, e is the third element in vs. If minO == -1 or minO > e, minO is updated based on the comparison with e. res is updated by adding e.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, vs contains at least 2 elements, e is the third element in vs. If minO == -1 or minO > e, minO is updated based on the comparison with e. res is updated by adding e**
