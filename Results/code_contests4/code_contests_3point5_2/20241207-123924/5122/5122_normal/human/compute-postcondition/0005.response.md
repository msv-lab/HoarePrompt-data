Example Answer:
The value of `e` is added to `res`, so `res` is updated accordingly. Since `e` is the first element in the list `vs`, after adding it to `res`, the new value of `res` will be the sum of the previous value of `res` and the value of `e`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, vs contains at least 1 element, e is the first element in vs, minO is -1, res is the sum of its previous value and the value of e.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, vs contains at least 1 element, e is the first element in vs, minO is -1, res is the sum of its previous value and the value of e**
