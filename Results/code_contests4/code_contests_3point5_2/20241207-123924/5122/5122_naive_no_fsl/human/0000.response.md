Correctness: False

The given program does not always produce the correct output. 

Example:
Input
3
1 1 1

Expected Output
2

Actual Output
1

Explanation:
In this case, the program should output 2 since Wet Shark can take two integers (1 and 1) for a total sum of 2, which is even. However, the program only outputs 1. This shows that the program does not always follow the problem description.
