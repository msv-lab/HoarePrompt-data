Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly finds the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after replacing one of them with an integer of choice between 1 and 10^9. The program follows the problem description by sorting the input integers, calculating the greatest common divisors in both forward and reverse order, and then finding the maximum possible greatest common divisor by comparing the calculated values. The program also handles the constraints specified in the problem description. Since the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and there are no cases identified where the program fails to produce the correct output, the correctness is deemed to be True.
