Example Answer: 
The value of `sep` is written to the file. The states of `file`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` remains the same, `file` writes the value of `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in the list if `at_start` is False for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`sep` remains the same, `file` writes the value of `sep`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in the list if `at_start` is False for the loop to execute another time**
