Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input, sorts a list `a` read from an unknown function `readlist()`, calculates two arrays `gcd_arr` and `gcd_arr_rev` representing the greatest common divisors of elements in `a` in forward and reverse order, and then finds the maximum value of the greatest common divisors between corresponding elements in `gcd_arr` and `gcd_arr_rev`. The function calls `func_2` with the result of this calculation.**
