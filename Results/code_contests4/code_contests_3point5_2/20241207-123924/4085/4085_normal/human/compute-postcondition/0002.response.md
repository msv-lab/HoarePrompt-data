According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 
Before the loop starts, `sep` is the value of 'sep' key in kwargs or b' ' if not found, `file` is the value of 'file' key in `kwargs` or sys.stdout if not found, `at_start` is True. 
Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `args` must have at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in the list.
State: **`sep` is the value of 'sep' key in kwargs or b' ' if not found, `file` is the value of 'file' key in `kwargs` or sys.stdout if not found, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list**
