Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`, so after execution, `at_start` is `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is the value of 'sep' key in kwargs or b' ' if not found, `file` is the value of 'file' key in `kwargs` or sys.stdout if not found, `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`sep` is the value of 'sep' key in kwargs or b' ' if not found, `file` is the value of 'file' key in `kwargs` or sys.stdout if not found, `at_start` is True**
