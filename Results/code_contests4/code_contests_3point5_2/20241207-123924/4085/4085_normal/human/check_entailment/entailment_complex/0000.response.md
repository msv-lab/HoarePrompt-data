Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads an integer `n` and a list `a` from the input. It then calculates two arrays `gcd_arr` and `gcd_arr_rev` representing the greatest common divisors of elements in `a` in forward and reverse order. Finally, it finds the maximum value of the greatest common divisors between corresponding elements in `gcd_arr` and `gcd_arr_rev`. The program then calls `func_2` to output the result. 

The code logic aligns with the problem description as it correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after a move, ensuring that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
