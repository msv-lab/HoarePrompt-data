You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N integers, A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, written on the blackboard.

You will choose one of them and replace it with an integer of your choice between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), possibly the same as the integer originally written.

Find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after your move.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Output

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N

Output

Print the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after your move.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(readlist())
    gcd_arr = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        gcd_arr[i + 1] = gcd(gcd_arr[i], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list, `gcd_arr` is a list where each element is the greatest common divisor of the corresponding elements in `a` and the previous element in `gcd_arr, with the first element being 0
    gcd_arr_rev = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        gcd_arr_rev[i] = gcd(gcd_arr_rev[i + 1], a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list, `gcd_arr` has at least 1 element, `gcd_arr_rev` has a length of n + 1 with updated values calculated by applying the gcd function in reverse order of the elements in `a`, `i` is 0.
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res = max(res, gcd(gcd_arr[i], gcd_arr_rev[i + 1]))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list, `gcd_arr` has at least 1 element, `gcd_arr_rev` has a length of n + 1 with updated values, `i` is n-1, `res` is the maximum value of gcd_arr and gcd_arr_rev
    func_2(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input, sorts a list `a` read from an unknown function `readlist()`, calculates two arrays `gcd_arr` and `gcd_arr_rev` representing the greatest common divisors of elements in `a` in forward and reverse order, and then finds the maximum value of the greatest common divisors between corresponding elements in `gcd_arr` and `gcd_arr_rev`. The function calls `func_2` with the result of this calculation.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sep` is the value of 'sep' key in `kwargs` or b' ' if not found, `file` is the value of 'file' key in `kwargs` or sys.stdout if not found, `at_start` is False, `args` is an empty list
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep` is the value of 'sep' key in `kwargs` or b' ' if not found, `file` is the value of 'file' key in `kwargs` or sys.stdout if not found, `at_start` is False, `args` is an empty list. If kwargs.pop('flush', False) is True, then the function will perform a flush operation. Otherwise, no action is taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and writes the elements in `args` to the `file` separated by `sep`. If the 'end' key is present in `kwargs`, it writes the corresponding value at the end. If the 'flush' key is True in `kwargs`, it flushes the file.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
