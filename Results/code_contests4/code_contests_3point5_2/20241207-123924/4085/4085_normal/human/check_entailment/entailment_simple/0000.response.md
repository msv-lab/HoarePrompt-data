Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the N integers on the blackboard after a move. It first calculates the greatest common divisor of each element with the previous elements and stores them in `gcd_arr`. Then, it calculates the greatest common divisor of each element with the following elements and stores them in `gcd_arr_rev`. Finally, it finds the maximum value between the two lists and outputs it. The program follows the problem description as it correctly computes the maximum GCD after replacing one of the integers with a number between 1 and 10^9.
