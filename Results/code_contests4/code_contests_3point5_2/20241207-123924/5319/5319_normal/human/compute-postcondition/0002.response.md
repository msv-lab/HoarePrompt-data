Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `k` plus the integer value of the input. Since the initial value of `k` is 0, the final value of `k` will be the integer value of the input. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`k` is the integer value of the input, `i` is 0**
