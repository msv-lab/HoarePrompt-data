Example Answer:
The value of `k` is updated by adding the integer value of the input to its current value. The previous value of `k` is already assigned as the integer value of the input. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `k` will be the sum of the two input integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`k` is the sum of the input integers, `i` is 1**
