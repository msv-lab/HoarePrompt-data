Example Answer: 
`k` is assigned the value of the current sum of input integers plus the new input integer. The initial value of `k` is the sum of the input integers. The value of `i` is 2, which is not affected by this code snippet. After execution, the new value of `k` will be the updated sum of the input integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the updated sum of the input integers, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`k` is the updated sum of the input integers, `i` is 2**
