According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the sum of the input integers, `i` is 1. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2.
State: **`k` is the sum of the input integers, `i` is 2**
