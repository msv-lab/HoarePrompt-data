According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of the input, `i` is 0. The for loop increases `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1.
State: **`k` is the integer value of the input, `i` is 1** for the loop to execute a second time.
