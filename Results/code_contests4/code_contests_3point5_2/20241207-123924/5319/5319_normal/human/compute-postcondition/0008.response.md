Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `k`, which is the sum of all input integers. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `k`, so the output state will be: `k` is the sum of all input integers, `i` is 9.
Output State: **`k` is the sum of all input integers, `i` is 9**
