Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads 10 integers representing the score of each question, sums them up, and then outputs the total score. This matches exactly with the problem description, which requires the program to output the total score of the 10 questions. The program does not have any preconditions and it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
