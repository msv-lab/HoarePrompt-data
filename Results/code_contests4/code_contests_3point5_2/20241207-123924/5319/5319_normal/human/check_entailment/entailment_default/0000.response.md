Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes 10 inputs representing the scores of 10 questions, sums them up, and prints the total score. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function calculates the total score by summing up the scores of 10 questions inputted by the user and prints the total score as an integer. Since the code correctly implements the specified logic and there are no potential cases identified where it would fail to provide the correct output, the code is considered correct.
