You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Welcome to PC Koshien, players. This year marks the 10th anniversary of Computer Koshien, but the number of questions and the total score will vary from year to year. Scores are set for each question according to the difficulty level. When the number of questions is 10 and the score of each question is given, create a program that outputs the total of them.



input

The input is given in the following format.


s1
s2
..
..
s10


The input consists of 10 lines, and the i line is given the integer si (0 ≤ si ≤ 100) representing the score of problem i.

output

Output the total score on one line.

Example

Input

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10


Output

55
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no specific precondition for this problem as the input values are simply 10 integers representing the score of each question.
def func():
    k = 0
    for i in range(10):
        k = k + int(input())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is the sum of all input integers, `i` is 9
    print(k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total score by summing up the scores of 10 questions inputted by the user and prints the total score as an integer.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
