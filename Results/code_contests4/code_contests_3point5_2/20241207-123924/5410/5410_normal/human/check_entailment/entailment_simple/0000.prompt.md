You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given N items.
The value of the i-th item (1 \leq i \leq N) is v_i.
Your have to select at least A and at most B of these items.
Under this condition, find the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items.
Additionally, find the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* 1 \leq A,B \leq N
* 1 \leq v_i \leq 10^{15}
* Each v_i is an integer.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N A B
v_1
v_2
...
v_N


Output

Print two lines.
The first line should contain the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items. The output should be considered correct if the absolute or relative error is at most 10^{-6}.
The second line should contain the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N. v_i are positive integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^15 for each i-th item.**
def func():
    N, A, B = map(int, raw_input().split())
    v = map(int, raw_input().split())
    resultValue = 0
    resultCount = 0
    for pcs in range(B - A + 1):
        perm = list(itertools.combinations(v, B + pcs))
        
        for cand in perm:
            average = float(sum(cand)) / len(cand)
            if resultValue < average:
                resultValue = average
                resultCount = 1
            elif resultValue == average:
                resultCount += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is B - A + 1, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs and contains at least B - A + 1 combinations, average is the maximum average calculated throughout all combinations in perm, resultValue is the maximum average calculated throughout all combinations in perm, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average occurs in the combinations
    print(resultValue)
    print(resultCount)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
