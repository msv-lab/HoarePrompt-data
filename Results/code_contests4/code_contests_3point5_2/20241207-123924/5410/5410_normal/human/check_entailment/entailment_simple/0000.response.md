Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input values of N, A, B, and the list of values v. It then calculates all possible combinations of items to select within the range of A to B items and finds the maximum average value of the selected items. It also counts the number of ways this maximum average can be achieved.

The program iterates through all possible combinations, calculates the average, and updates the resultValue if a higher average is found. It also updates the resultCount if the same maximum average is found multiple times.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the values of selected items and the number of ways to achieve this maximum mean, as required by the problem description.
