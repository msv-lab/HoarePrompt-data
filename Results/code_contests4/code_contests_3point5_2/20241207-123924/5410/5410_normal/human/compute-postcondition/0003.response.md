Example Answer:
`resultCount` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N, v contains user-input integers, resultValue is 0, resultCount is 0.
Output State: **N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N, v contains user-input integers, resultValue is 0, resultCount is 0**
