According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `perm` and `cand`. If there are at least 4 combinations in `perm`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` contains at least 3 combinations, average is the average of the elements in the last combination of perm. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `perm` must contain at least 4 combinations and `cand` should be the fourth combination.
State: **N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is B - A + 2, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs and contains at least 4 combinations, average is the average of the elements in the fourth combination of perm, resultValue is the maximum average calculated throughout all combinations in perm, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average occurs in the combinations. If resultValue is less than average, resultCount is 1. If resultValue is equal to average, resultCount is incremented by 1.**
