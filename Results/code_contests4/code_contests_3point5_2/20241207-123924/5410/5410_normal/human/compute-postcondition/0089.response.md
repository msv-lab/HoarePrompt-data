Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for N, A, B, and a list of positive integers v. It then calculates the maximum average of combinations of elements from v with lengths ranging from B to B + N. The function prints the maximum average value and the number of times it occurs in the combinations. The function does not return any specific output.** 

The functionality of the function is to compute average values of different combinations of elements from the input list v and find the maximum average. It then prints this maximum average and the number of times it occurs in the combinations. The function operates within the constraints specified for N, A, B, and the elements in v.
