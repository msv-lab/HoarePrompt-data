Example Answer:
The code snippet `v = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits the input into separate values, converts them into integers, and stores them in the list `v`. Since the initial state does not mention any specific values for N, A, or B, we can't determine the exact values of the elements in the list. Therefore, the output state is: N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N, and the list v contains the user-input integers.
Output State: **N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N, v contains user-input integers**
