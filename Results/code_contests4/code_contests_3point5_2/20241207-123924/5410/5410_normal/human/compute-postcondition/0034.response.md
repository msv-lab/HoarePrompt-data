Example Answer:
The average is calculated by summing all elements in `cand` and dividing by the length of `cand`. Since the previous values of `cand` are unknown, the output state is: N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is `B - A + 1`, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of `B + pcs`, average is the average of the elements in the last combination of perm, resultValue is the maximum average calculated throughout all combinations in perm, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average occurs in the combinations, for the loop to execute the first time perm list has at least 1 combination.
Output State: **N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is `B - A + 1`, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of `B + pcs`, average is the average of the elements in the last combination of perm, resultValue is the maximum average calculated throughout all combinations in perm, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average occurs in the combinations, for the loop to execute the first time perm list has at least 1 combination**
