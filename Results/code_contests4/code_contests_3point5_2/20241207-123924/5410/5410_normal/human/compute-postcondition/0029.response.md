Postcondition: ***N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is 0, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs, average is the average of the elements in the next combination of perm, there are more combinations in perm. If resultValue < average, resultCount remains unchanged. If resultValue is equal to average, resultCount is incremented by 1. If resultValue is not less than average and not equal to average, the resultCount is incremented by 1.***
