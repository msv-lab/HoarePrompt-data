According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `perm` and `pcs`. If `perm` is not empty and `pcs` is 0, the loop can execute. The loop will iterate through each `cand` in `perm`. At the start of the loop, `cand` will be the first combination in `perm`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute `perm` must not be empty, `pcs` must be 0, and `cand` should be the first combination in `perm`.
State: **N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is 0, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs, for the loop to execute cand is the first combination in perm**
