Example Answer:
N, A, B are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. The values of N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N. Therefore, the Output State is: N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N.
Output State: **N, A, B are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 50, 1 <= A, B <= N**
