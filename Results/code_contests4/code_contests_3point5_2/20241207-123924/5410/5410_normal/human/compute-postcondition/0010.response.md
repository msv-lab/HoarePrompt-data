Example Answer:
`resultCount` is assigned the value 1. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is 0, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs, average is the average of the elements in the first combination of perm, resultValue is less than average, resultValue is now equal to the average, resultCount is 1.
Output State: **N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is 0, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs, average is the average of the elements in the first combination of perm, resultValue is less than average, resultValue is now equal to the average, resultCount is 1**
