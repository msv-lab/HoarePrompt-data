Postcondition: ***N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is B - A + 2, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs and contains at least 4 combinations, average is the average of the elements in the fourth combination of perm, resultValue is the maximum average calculated throughout all combinations in perm, resultCount is the number of times the maximum average occurs in the combinations. If resultValue is less than average, resultCount is 1. If resultValue is equal to average, resultCount is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if else block, the program remains in the same state as described in the precondition.***
