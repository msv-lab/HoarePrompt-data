Example Answer:
The average is calculated by summing the elements in `cand` and dividing by the length of `cand`. There is no information provided about the initial value of `cand`, so the output state is: N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is 0, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs, average is the average of the elements in the next combination of perm, there are more combinations in perm, if resultValue < average, resultCount remains unchanged. If resultValue is equal to average, resultCount is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is 0, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs, average is the average of the elements in the next combination of perm, there are more combinations in perm, if resultValue < average, resultCount remains unchanged. If resultValue is equal to average, resultCount is incremented by 1**
