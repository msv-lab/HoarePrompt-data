Example Answer:
The average is calculated by summing all elements in `cand` and dividing by the length of `cand`. Since `cand` is the first combination in `perm`, the average is computed based on those elements. The variables `N`, `A`, `B`, `pcs`, and `perm` are not affected by this calculation.
Output State: **N is between 1 and 50, A is between 1 and N, B is between 1 and N, B is greater than or equal to A, pcs is 0, perm is a list of combinations of elements in v with a length of B + pcs, average is the average of the elements in the first combination of perm**
