Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the maximum possible arithmetic mean of the selected items, and finds the number of ways to select items so that the mean of the values of selected items is maximized. It uses combinations to generate all possible combinations of items within the range specified by A and B, calculates the average value of each combination, and updates the resultValue and resultCount accordingly. The logic seems to be correct and covers all possible cases.
