#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52. Each card is represented by a pair of a character (suit) and an integer (rank). The suit is one of 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' representing spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds respectively. The rank is an integer from 1 to 13.**
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    d = {'S': [None] * 13, 'H': [None] * 13, 'C': [None] * 13, 'D': [None] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = raw_input().split()
        
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements with some elements set to True based on user input, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split. The loop will not execute as it continues when the condition (d[k][i]) is true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input to create a representation of a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Each card is represented by a pair of a character (suit) and an integer (rank) within the specified constraints. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotation and the actual code execution. The code initializes a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and values as lists of 13 elements each. It then iterates through user input to set certain elements in the lists to True. Finally, it attempts to print out the cards that were not set to True, but due to the 'continue' statement, this loop will never execute as intended. Therefore, the code does not generate and return a list of all 52 playing cards as the annotation suggests.
