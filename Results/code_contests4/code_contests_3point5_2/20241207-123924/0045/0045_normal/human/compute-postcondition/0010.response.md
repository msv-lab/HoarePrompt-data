Example Answer:
The boolean value True is assigned to the element at index int(y) - 1 in the sublist of d at index x. The variables n, i, and d remain unchanged. The values of x and y are assigned from user input split, so the specific values are unknown. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than the current value of `i`, `d` remains unchanged, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split**
