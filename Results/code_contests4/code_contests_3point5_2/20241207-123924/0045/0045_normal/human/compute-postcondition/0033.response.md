According to the code, the loop will execute 13 times, incrementing `i` each time until `i` reaches 12. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 12. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 13.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split, `i` is 13**.
