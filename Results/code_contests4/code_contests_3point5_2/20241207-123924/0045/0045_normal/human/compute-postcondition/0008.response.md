According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than the current value of `i`, `d` remains unchanged, `x` and `y` remain unchanged**
