Example Answer:
The element at index `int(y) - 1` in the list corresponding to key `x` in dictionary `d` is set to True. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n+1`. The initial state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements initialized to None, `x` and `y` are assigned the values from input split. After execution, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements with one element set to True, `x` and `y` are assigned the values from input split. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements with one element set to True, `x` and `y` are assigned the values from input split**
