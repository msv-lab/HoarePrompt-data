Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split. The loop will iterate through all elements in the dictionary `d` for each key and if the condition `d[k][i]` is false, it will print the key `k` and the value `i + 1` formatted accordingly.**
