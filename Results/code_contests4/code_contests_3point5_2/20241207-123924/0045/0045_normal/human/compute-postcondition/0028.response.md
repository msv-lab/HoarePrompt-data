According to the code, since the loop iterates over the range of 13, the loop will always execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split, `i` is 0**
