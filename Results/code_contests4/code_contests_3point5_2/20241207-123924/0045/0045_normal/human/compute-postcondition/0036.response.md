Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split, `i` is 13. If the element at index `i` of the list corresponding to key `k` in dictionary `d` is considered true, then the program executes based on the condition. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. The program prints the key `k` and the value of `i + 1`.**
