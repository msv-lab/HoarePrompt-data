Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split, `i` is 0. If the value at index `i` of the list associated with key `k` in dictionary `d` is true, the program executes accordingly.***
