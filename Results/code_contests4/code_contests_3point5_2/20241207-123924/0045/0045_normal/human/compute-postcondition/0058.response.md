The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to generate and return a list of all 52 playing cards in a standard deck. Each card is represented by a pair of a character (suit) and an integer (rank), where the suit can be 'S' for spades, 'H' for hearts, 'C' for clubs, or 'D' for diamonds, and the rank is an integer from 1 to 13. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to generate and return a list of all 52 playing cards in a standard deck, where each card is represented by a pair of a character (suit) and an integer (rank) within the specified constraints.
