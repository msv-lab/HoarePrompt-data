According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if the element at index 'i' of the list corresponding to the next key 'k' in the loop in dictionary 'd' is false. So, at the end of the previous iteration, you need to find the next key 'k' in the dictionary 'd' where the element at index 'i' is false. Once that is identified, you need to update the state as follows:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split, after entering the if condition (d[k][i]) is true. The output will be the key 'k' and the value (i + 1) printed in the specified format**.
