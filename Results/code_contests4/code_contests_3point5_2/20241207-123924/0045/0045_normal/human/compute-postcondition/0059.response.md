Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input to create a representation of a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Each card is represented by a pair of a character (suit) and an integer (rank) within the specified constraints. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotation and the actual code execution. The code initializes a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and values as lists of 13 elements each. It then iterates through user input to set certain elements in the lists to True. Finally, it attempts to print out the cards that were not set to True, but due to the 'continue' statement, this loop will never execute as intended. Therefore, the code does not generate and return a list of all 52 playing cards as the annotation suggests.**
