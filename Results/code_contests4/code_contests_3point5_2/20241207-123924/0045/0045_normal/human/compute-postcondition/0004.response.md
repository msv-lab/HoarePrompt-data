Example Answer:
`True` is assigned to the element at index `int(y) - 1` in the list corresponding to key `x` in dictionary `d`. The initial state of `n`, `d`, `x`, and `y` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements initialized to None, `x` and `y` are assigned the values from input split, the element at index `int(y) - 1` in the list corresponding to key `x` in dictionary `d` is True.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements initialized to None, `x` and `y` are assigned the values from input split, the element at index `int(y) - 1` in the list corresponding to key `x` in dictionary `d` is True**
