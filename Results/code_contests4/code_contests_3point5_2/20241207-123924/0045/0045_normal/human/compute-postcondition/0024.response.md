Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is 14. If the condition `d[k][i]` is true, then the program executes a certain action based on the value of `d[k][i]`.***
