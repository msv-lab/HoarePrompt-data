Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split. For the loop to execute one more time, the element at index 'i' of the list corresponding to the next key 'k' in the loop in dictionary 'd' should be considered false, where `i` corresponds to the next key 'k' in dictionary 'd' and the element at that index is false. After entering the if condition (d[k][i]) is true.***
