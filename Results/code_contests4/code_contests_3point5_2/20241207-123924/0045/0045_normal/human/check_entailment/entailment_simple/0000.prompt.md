You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Taro is going to play a card game. However, now he has only n cards, even though there should be 52 cards (he has no Jokers).

The 52 cards include 13 ranks of each of the four suits: spade, heart, club and diamond.

Note

解説



Input

In the first line, the number of cards n (n ≤ 52) is given.

In the following n lines, data of the n cards are given. Each card is given by a pair of a character and an integer which represent its suit and rank respectively. A suit is represented by 'S', 'H', 'C' and 'D' for spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds respectively. A rank is represented by an integer from 1 to 13.

Output

Print the missing cards. The same as the input format, each card should be printed with a character and an integer separated by a space character in a line. Arrange the missing cards in the following priorities:

* Print cards of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds in this order.
* If the suits are equal, print cards with lower ranks first.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52. Each card is represented by a pair of a character (suit) and an integer (rank). The suit is one of 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' representing spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds respectively. The rank is an integer from 1 to 13.**
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    d = {'S': [None] * 13, 'H': [None] * 13, 'C': [None] * 13, 'D': [None] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = raw_input().split()
        
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements with some elements set to True based on user input, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 52, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and each key has a list of 13 elements, `x` and `y` are assigned values from user input split. The loop will not execute as it continues when the condition (d[k][i]) is true.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
