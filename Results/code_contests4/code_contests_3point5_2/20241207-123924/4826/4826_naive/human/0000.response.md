Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads the input, sorts the coordinates, calculates the minimal distance between two cities, and counts the number of pairs with this distance. It iterates through the sorted coordinates and updates the minimal distance and count accordingly. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
