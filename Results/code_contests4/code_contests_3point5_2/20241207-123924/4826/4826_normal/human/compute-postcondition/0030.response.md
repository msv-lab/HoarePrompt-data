Postcondition: ***`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object with at least one element, `temp_dist` is updated based on the next elements in the map object and the value of `x`, `count` is either 1 or 2, `index` is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the map object in ascending order, for the loop to execute one more time the conditions `index < len(coordinates) - 1` and `temp_dist < dist` must still hold true. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, `count` is increased by 1 and `index` is incremented by 1.***
