Example Answer:
The code prints the values of `dist` and `count` after converting them to strings and concatenating them with a space. The variables `cities`, `coordinates`, `dist`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object with at least one element, `dist` is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the `coordinates` map object, `count` is the number of times the minimum difference occurs.
Output State: **`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object with at least one element, `dist` is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the `coordinates` map object, `count` is the number of times the minimum difference occurs**
