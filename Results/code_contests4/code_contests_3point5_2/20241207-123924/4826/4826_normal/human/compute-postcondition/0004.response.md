Example Answer:
`count` is initialized to 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object containing integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 0.
Output State: **`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object containing integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 0**
