Postcondition: ***`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object with at least one element, `dist` is 2000000000, `count` is 0, `index` is an integer less than the length of `coordinates` - 1, `x` is the first element in the map object in ascending order, `temp_dist` is the result of subtracting the first element in the map object from the element at index + 1. The `temp_dist` is less than `dist`.***
