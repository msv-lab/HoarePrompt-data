Postcondition: ***`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object with at least one element. If `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is updated to the value of `temp_dist`, `count` is set to 1, `index` is an integer less than the length of `coordinates` - 1, `x` is the first element in the map object in ascending order, and `temp_dist` is the result of subtracting the first element in the map object from the element at index + 1. If `temp_dist` is greater than or equal to `dist`, then `dist` remains 2000000000, `count` is set to 1, `index` is an integer less than the length of `coordinates` - 1, and `x` is the first element in the map object in ascending order. If `temp_dist` is equal to `dist`, then `count` is updated to 1.***
