Postcondition: ***`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object with at least one element, `temp_dist` is updated based on the next elements in the map object and the value of `x`, `count` is either 1 or 2, `index` is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in the map object in ascending order. If `index` is less than `len(coordinates) - 1` and `temp_dist` is less than `dist`, then `dist` is assigned the value of `temp_dist` and `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 2.***
