Example Answer:
`dist` is assigned the value `2 * 10 ** 9`, which is equal to 2000000000. The variables `cities` and `coordinates` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object containing integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is 2000000000.
Output State: **`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object containing integers sorted in ascending order, `dist` is 2000000000**
