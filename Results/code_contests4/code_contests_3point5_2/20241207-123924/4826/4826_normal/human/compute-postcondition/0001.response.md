Example Answer:
The code reads integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variable `coordinates` after converting them into a map object. The variable `cities` is an integer input by the user, but its value is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object containing integers from the standard input.
Output State: **`cities` is an integer input by the user, `coordinates` is a map object containing integers from the standard input**
