The function `func` reads an integer `cities` from the standard input, followed by a list of coordinates. It then sorts the coordinates, calculates the minimum distance between consecutive elements, and counts the occurrences of that minimum distance. Finally, it prints the minimum distance and the count of occurrences. The function does not explicitly return any value.
