Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal possible distance between two pairs of cities and the quantity of pairs with this distance. It sorts the coordinates, then iterates through the sorted list to calculate the difference between consecutive elements and keep track of the minimum difference and the count of pairs with that minimum difference. This approach ensures that the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
