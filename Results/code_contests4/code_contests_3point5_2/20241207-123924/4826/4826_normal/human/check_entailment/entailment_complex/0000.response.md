Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, sorts the coordinates, calculates the minimum distance between consecutive elements, and counts the occurrences of that minimum distance. Finally, it prints the minimum distance and the count of occurrences. The program follows the requirements specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
