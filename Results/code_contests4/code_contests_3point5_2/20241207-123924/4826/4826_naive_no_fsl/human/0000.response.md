Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, sorts the coordinates, calculates the minimum distance between two cities, and counts the number of pairs with that minimum distance. It iterates through the sorted coordinates to find the minimum distance and updates the count accordingly. The logic seems correct and covers all potential cases as per the problem description. The output format is also as expected. Overall, the program appears to be correct.
