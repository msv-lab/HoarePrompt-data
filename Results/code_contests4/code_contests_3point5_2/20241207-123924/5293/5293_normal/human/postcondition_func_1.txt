The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a positive integer `n` representing the number of balls in each test case. The function iterates through the sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case to determine the arrangement of balls. There is no explicit return value from the function, but it is likely that the function performs operations or calculations to achieve the desired ball arrangement for each test case. The function writes the processed data to a specified file stream or `sys.stdout` based on the provided constraints. However, there is missing functionality in the annotations regarding how the ball arrangement is determined and the specific operations performed within the function.
