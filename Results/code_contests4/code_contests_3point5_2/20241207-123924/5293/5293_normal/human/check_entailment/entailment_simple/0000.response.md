Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of colors Nezzar can use. The `func_2()` function is incomplete and does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the minimum number of colors. The logic for coloring the balls based on the given conditions is missing.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and does not provide the correct output. It needs to be revised to include the necessary logic to determine the minimum number of colors based on the given conditions.
