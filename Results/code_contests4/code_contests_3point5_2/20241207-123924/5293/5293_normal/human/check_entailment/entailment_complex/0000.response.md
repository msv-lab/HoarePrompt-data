Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` is missing the necessary logic to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the balls as described in the problem. The annotations also do not provide clarity on how the ball coloring is being calculated. Without this essential logic, the code is unable to accurately determine the minimum number of colors required by Nezzar. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
