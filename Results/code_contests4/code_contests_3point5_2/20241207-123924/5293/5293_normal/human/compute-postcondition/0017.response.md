Example Answer:
The `str(x)` is written to the file determined by the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`. The value of `x` is the next element in `args` if `at_start` is False. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` can be any value, `file` is determined by the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, and `x` is the next element in `args` if `at_start` is False and the value of `x` has been written to the file.
Output State: **`sep` can be any value, `file` is determined by the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in `args` if `at_start` is False, and the value of `x` has been written to the file**
