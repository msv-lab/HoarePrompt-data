Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sep` can be any value, `file` is determined by the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, and all elements in `args` have been written to the file. The value popped from `kwargs` with the key 'end' is written to the file using the `write` method.**
