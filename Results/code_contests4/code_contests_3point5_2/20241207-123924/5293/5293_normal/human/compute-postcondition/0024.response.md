The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters explicitly. The function relies on the input constraints provided in the description, specifically the positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases and the positive integer `n` representing the number of balls for each test case, along with the sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Based on the input constraints and relationships, the function `func_2` processes each test case to determine the arrangement of the balls in a specific order. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it likely performs some operations or calculations on the input data to achieve the desired arrangement of balls.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process multiple test cases, each consisting of a sequence of integers representing the arrangement of balls, without explicitly accepting any parameters.
