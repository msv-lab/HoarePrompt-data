Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `sep` can have any value, `file` is determined by the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, and all elements in `args` have been written to the file. Additionally, the value popped from `kwargs` with the key 'end' is written to the file using the `write` method if the 'flush' key was popped from `kwargs`, otherwise no changes occur.***
