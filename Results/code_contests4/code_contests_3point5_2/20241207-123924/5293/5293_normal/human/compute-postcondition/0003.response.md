According to the code, the loop can execute based on the `args` list. If the list `args` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `sep` is assigned the value of 'sep' key in kwargs or ' ', `file` is assigned the value of 'file' key in kwargs or `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is True. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `args` should have at least 1 element, and `x` should be set to the first element in `args`.
State: **`sep` is assigned the value of 'sep' key in kwargs or ' ', `file` is assigned the value of 'file' key in kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args`**
