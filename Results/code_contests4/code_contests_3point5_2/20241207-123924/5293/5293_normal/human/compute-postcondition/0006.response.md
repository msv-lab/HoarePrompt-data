Postcondition: ***`sep` can be any value, `file` is determined by the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `args` if `at_start` is False. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x`.***
