Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly computes the minimum possible height of the tallest tower as described in the problem description for all potential cases. It iterates through possible tower heights and checks if the conditions for the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces are satisfied. If the conditions are met, it prints the minimum height necessary for the tallest tower. The program covers all possible scenarios and produces the correct output for each case.
