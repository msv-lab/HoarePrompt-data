Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it is evident that the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The functions defined in the code are designed to handle the input constraints specified in the problem description, such as non-negative integers for the number of students using two-block and three-block pieces, ensuring that no two students' towers have the same number of blocks, and calculating the minimum height necessary for the tallest tower.

Additionally, the annotations, although providing some edge cases, do not highlight any discrepancies or cases where the program deviates from the problem description. Furthermore, the code structure and logic appear to be in line with the requirements outlined in the problem description, ensuring the correctness of the program.
