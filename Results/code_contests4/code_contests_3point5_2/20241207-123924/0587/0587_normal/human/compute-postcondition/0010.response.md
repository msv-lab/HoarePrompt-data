Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file assigned to `file`. The value of `sep` can be from `kwargs` or a space ' '. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `args` is a list with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in the list.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `args` is a list with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in the list**
