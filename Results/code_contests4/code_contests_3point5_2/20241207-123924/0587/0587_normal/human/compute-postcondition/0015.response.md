Example Answer:
`file.write(sep)` is executed, which writes the value of `sep` to the file specified in `file`. The value of `sep` can be either from `kwargs` or a space ' '. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `args` is a list with at least three elements, the next element after `x` in the list is the new `x`, `at_start` is False, and the value of `sep` has been written to the file.
