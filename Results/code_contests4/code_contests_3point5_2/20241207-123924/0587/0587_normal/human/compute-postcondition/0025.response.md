Functionality: **The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writes them to the `file` with the specified separator `sep`, and ends with a newline character. If the 'flush' key is present in the `kwargs` dictionary and set to True, the `file` is flushed. The function does not return any value.**
