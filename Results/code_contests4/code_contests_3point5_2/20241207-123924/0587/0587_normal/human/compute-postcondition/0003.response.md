According to the code, the loop can execute if the `args` list has at least one element. Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` being non-negative integers such that n + m > 0 does not ensure the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `args` must have at least one element, and `x` should be the first element in the list. 
State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the first element in the list**
