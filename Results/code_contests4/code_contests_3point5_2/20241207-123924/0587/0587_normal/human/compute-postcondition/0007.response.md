Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is assigned True initially, for the loop to execute the first time. If `at_start` is False, then `n` and `m` are still non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, for the loop to execute the subsequent times, `args` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the first element in the list.**
