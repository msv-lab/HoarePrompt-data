Example Answer:
The variables `sep` and `file` are assigned values from the dictionary `kwargs` using the `pop` method. If 'sep' key is present in `kwargs`, `sep` is assigned its value; otherwise, `sep` is assigned a space ' '. If 'file' key is present in `kwargs`, `file` is assigned its value; otherwise, `file` is assigned `sys.stdout`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`**
