According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `args` list. At the end of the last iteration, `args` has at least one element, `x` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still have at least one more element after the current `x` is processed.
State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0, `sep` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or a space ' ', `file` is assigned a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `args` is a list with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in the list**
