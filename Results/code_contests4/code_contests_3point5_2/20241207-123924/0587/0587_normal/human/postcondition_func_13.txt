The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where `x + y > 0`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of `x` divided by `y`. If the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is not equal to 0, the function returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. The code accurately implements these conditions.
