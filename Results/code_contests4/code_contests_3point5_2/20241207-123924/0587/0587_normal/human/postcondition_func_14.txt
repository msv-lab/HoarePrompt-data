The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. `x` and `y` are non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block and three-block pieces respectively. `p` is a positive integer representing the total number of students (p = x + y). The function updates the value of 'res' based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet. After the loop has finished executing, the program returns the final value of 'res'. If the code does not handle the case where `p` is not 0 or `y` is not 0, this missing functionality should be considered in the summary.
