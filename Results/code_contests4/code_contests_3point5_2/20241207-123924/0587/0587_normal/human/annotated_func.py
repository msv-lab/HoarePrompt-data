def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return the input provided by the user. The function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input or error handling.

def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the integer values obtained by splitting the input string and converting them into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string, splits it into substrings using whitespace as a delimiter, converts these substrings into integers, and returns a map object containing these integer values. The constraints specify that the input integers n and m are non-negative and their sum is greater than 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.**
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the string representation of the input values after stripping and splitting them
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing the string representation of the input values after stripping and splitting them. The code does not take into account the initial condition that n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0. Additionally, it does not handle any potential errors that may arise during the input processing.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread targeting the `main` function, and starts the thread. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The annotations state that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, but this information is not utilized in the function.

def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the value at index 1 of the variable 'item'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an iterable `item` and returns the value at index 1 of the variable 'item'. The function assumes the input `item` is an iterable object. It does not handle cases where `item` is not an iterable object or if the length of `item` is less than 2.

    #The program returns list 'l' sorted in descending order based on the custom key function 'getKey'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns the list sorted in descending order based on a custom key function 'getKey'. The code sorts the list 'l' in descending order using the custom key function 'getKey'. It assumes 'getKey' is defined elsewhere in the code, and it does not handle cases where 'getKey' is missing or incorrectly defined.

    #The program returns a 2D list with 'n' rows and 'm' columns, where each element in the list is the positive integer 'num'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts non-negative integers n and m (such that n + m > 0) and a positive integer num, and returns a 2D list with n rows and m columns, where each element is the positive integer num. The function does not perform any additional operations or checks beyond creating the specified 2D list.

    #The program returns the tuple x after performing a bitwise operation 'not x & x - 1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_10 accepts a tuple x consisting of two non-negative integers n and m. It performs a bitwise operation 'not x & x - 1' on x and returns the resulting tuple. However, the current implementation does not accurately reflect the postconditions provided, and it may not handle all edge cases as described.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_11 accepts a tuple 'n' of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces respectively. It then converts the tuple 'n' to its binary representation after removing the '0b' prefix.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a tuple of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces, respectively.**
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing the two non-negative integers present in the tuple 'n' after converting them to integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_12 accepts a tuple `n` of two non-negative integers, converts them to integers, and returns a list containing these two values. If the tuple `n` contains elements that are not integers or if the tuple does not have exactly two elements, the function does not handle these cases and may result in a ValueError or incorrect output.

    #The program returns the result of calculating the combination of choosing r elements from a set of n elements, where n and m are non-negative integers such that n + m > 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `r`, and calculates the combination of choosing r elements from a set of n elements using the factorial function. The function returns the result of this calculation. The function assumes that n and r are non-negative integers and n + m > 0.

    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer division of x by y plus 1, where x and y are non-negative integers such that x + y > 0 and the remainder of x divided by y is not equal to 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where `x + y > 0`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the result of `x` divided by `y`. If the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is not equal to 0, the function returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. The code accurately implements these conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block and three-block pieces respectively, and p is a positive integer representing the total number of students (p = x + y).**

    #The program returns the value of 'res' which has been updated based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet. 'x', 'y', 'p' are non-negative integers where 'p' is 0 and 'y' is 0. The loop has finished executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`. `x` and `y` are non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block and three-block pieces respectively. `p` is a positive integer representing the total number of students (p = x + y). The function updates the value of 'res' based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet. After the loop has finished executing, the program returns the final value of 'res'. If the code does not handle the case where `p` is not 0 or `y` is not 0, this missing functionality should be considered in the summary.

def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: x contains the GCD of the initial x and y values, y is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the initial x and y values, where y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `x` and `y`, such that `x + y > 0`. It then calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the initial `x` and `y` values iteratively until `y` becomes 0. The function returns the GCD of `x` and 0.

        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a tuple of two non-negative integers representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces respectively. n is greater than 1 and the tuple n does not have a value less than or equal to 3.

    return True
    #The program returns True after completing the loop with 'i' having a value of 11
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_17` accepts a tuple `n` representing the number of students using two-block pieces and three-block pieces. The program then goes through multiple conditional checks and loops. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns False. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it returns True. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False. Otherwise, it iterates through a loop to check for additional divisibility conditions. If none of the previous conditions are met, the function returns True after completing the loop with 'i' having a value of 11. The functionality covers the main cases outlined in the annotations, but it does not match the expected return values for all given cases in the annotations.

def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` reassigns the standard input and output to read from and write to files. It does not accept any parameters, but it works with non-negative integers `n` and `m` such that `n + m > 0`. The function itself does not have a specific output or computation logic.

If `n` is less than or equal to `i // 2` and `m` is less than or equal to `i // 3` and `n + m` is less than or equal to `i // 2 + i // 3 - i // 6`, then the loop executes and `func_20(i)` is called. Otherwise, the loop does not execute and `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` retrieves values for `n` and `m` from `func_3`, then iterates through a range of numbers up to 1000000. If certain conditions involving `n`, `m`, and `i` are met, it calls `func_20(i)` and breaks the loop. However, the function does not explicitly return any output.

If `kwargs` has the key 'flush' and its corresponding value is True, then the `file` is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over the elements in `args`, writes them to the `file` with the specified separator `sep`, and ends with a newline character. If the 'flush' key is present in the `kwargs` dictionary and set to True, the `file` is flushed. The function does not return any value.
