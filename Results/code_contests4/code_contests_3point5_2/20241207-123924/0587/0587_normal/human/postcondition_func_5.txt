The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread targeting the `main` function, and starts the thread. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The annotations state that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that `n + m > 0`, but this information is not utilized in the function.
