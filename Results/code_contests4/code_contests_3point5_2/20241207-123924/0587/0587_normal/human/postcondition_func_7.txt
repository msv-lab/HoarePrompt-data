The function func_8 accepts a list 'l' and returns the list sorted in descending order based on a custom key function 'getKey'. The code sorts the list 'l' in descending order using the custom key function 'getKey'. It assumes 'getKey' is defined elsewhere in the code, and it does not handle cases where 'getKey' is missing or incorrectly defined.
