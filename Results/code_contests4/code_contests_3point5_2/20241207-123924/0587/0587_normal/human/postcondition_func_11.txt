The function func_12 accepts a tuple `n` of two non-negative integers, converts them to integers, and returns a list containing these two values. If the tuple `n` contains elements that are not integers or if the tuple does not have exactly two elements, the function does not handle these cases and may result in a ValueError or incorrect output.
