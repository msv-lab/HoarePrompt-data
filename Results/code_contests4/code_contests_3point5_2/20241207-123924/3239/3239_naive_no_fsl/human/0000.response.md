Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a sequence of composite numbers. It then colors the elements based on certain conditions such that the GCD of elements of the same color is greater than 1.

The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It iterates through the elements, checks their divisibility by certain prime numbers, and assigns colors accordingly. The output also follows the required format.

Since the program covers all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and there are no apparent logical errors, we can conclude that the program is correct.
