You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.

Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,…,a_n.

She wants to choose an integer m ≤ 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:

  * for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color; 
  * each element is colored and colored exactly one color; 
  * the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. 



Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.

Alice showed already that if all a_i ≤ 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m ≤ 11.

Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the amount of numbers in a sequence a.

The second line of the test case contains n composite integers a_1,a_2,…,a_n (4 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output

For each test case print 2 lines. The first line should contain a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 11) — the number of used colors. Consider colors to be numbered from 1 to m. The second line should contain any coloring that satisfies the above conditions. Print n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ m), where c_i is the color of the i-th element. If there are multiple solutions then you can print any of them. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.

Remember that each color from 1 to m should be used at least once. Any two elements of the same color should not be coprime (i.e. their GCD should be greater than 1).

4 7 8 10 7 3 10 7 7 8 3 1 1 5 5 9 2 2 3 3 4 11 6

Note

In the first test case, \gcd(6,10)=2, \gcd(6,15)=3 and \gcd(10,15)=5. Therefore, it's valid to color all elements the same color. Note that there are other colorings which satisfy Alice's requirement in this test case.

In the second test case there is only one element of each color, so the coloring definitely satisfies Alice's requirement.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each composite number a_i in the sequence is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000.**
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 prompts the user to input an integer and returns that integer as the output. The function does not have any specific constraints on the input integer other than being an integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- a_i is a composite integer such that 4 <= a_i <= 1000.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input value as it is without any modification
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input value without any modification. It does not perform any specific operations on the input value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- Each a_i is a composite integer such that 4 <= a_i <= 1000.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3() reads input from the user, splits it, and returns a map object containing integers. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `n` as indicated in the annotations. The annotations mention specific constraints on `t`, `n`, and `a_i`, but these constraints are not utilized in the actual function.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function func_3(). The specific content of the returned list will depend on the implementation of func_3().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_3()`. The content of the returned list is dependent on the implementation of `func_3()`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It redirects the standard input and output to 'input.txt' and 'output.txt' respectively. This function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is simply to perform file redirection for input and output.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` holds the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` must be 0. It then calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x` and `y` when `y` is 0. The function effectively implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- a_i is a composite integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000 for each element in the sequence a.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: At the end of the loop, `f` will be a list of frequencies of numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 in the list `a`. `g` will be a list of the last updated values of `j` for each condition. `l` will be a list containing values based on the conditions met during the iterations. `n` will be the value returned by `func_1()`. `j` will have a final value based on the conditions encountered in the loop. The elements of list `l` will be a combination of elements from list `g` and values of `j` based on the conditions. The functions `func_8(max(l))` and `func_8(*l)` will be called at the end of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` iterates over a list `a` of composite integers and categorizes them based on their divisibility by certain numbers. It updates frequency and last updated values in lists `f` and `g` respectively. It then generates a list `l` based on the conditions met during the iteration. Finally, it calls functions `func_8(max(l))` and `func_8(*l)`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args` are assigned values from `kwargs` with default values. All elements in `args` have been written to `file` separated by `sep`. If 'flush' key exists in `kwargs` and its value is True, then 'flush' key is popped from `kwargs` with a default value of False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It processes and writes elements from the `args` list to the `file` stream separated by the `sep` value. It then writes the 'end' value to the `file` stream and flushes the stream if the 'flush' key is present and set to True in the `kwargs` dictionary. However, the function lacks the initial definition of `args` and does not calculate the sum of composite integers as indicated in the annotations.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
