According to the code, the loop execution depends on several variables and conditions. To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
- The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time.
- `n` is greater than 0, so the loop can continue.
- `j` is either 0 or 1 based on a condition.
- The element at index `i` in list `a` must be even for the loop to proceed.
- Depending on certain conditions, the element at index 1 of list `f` is updated to true or remains zero.
- If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13, then elements of `f` and `g` are updated based on divisibility conditions.

State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. Depending on the condition, the element at index 1 of list `f` is true or remains zero. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13, then various elements of `f` and `g` are updated based on the divisibility conditions of `a[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the necessary states should be adjusted accordingly.
