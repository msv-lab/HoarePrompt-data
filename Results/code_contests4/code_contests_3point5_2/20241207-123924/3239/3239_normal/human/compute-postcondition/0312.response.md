Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2 and divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is true, `l` contains the value of `g[2]`. If `f[2]` is false, `l` is a list containing the value 1.***
