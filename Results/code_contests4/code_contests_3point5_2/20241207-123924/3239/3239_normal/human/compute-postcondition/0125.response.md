Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros and a single 1 at index 11, `g` is a list containing either 12 zeros or 1 at index 8, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a` is a list. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 5, the element at index 3 in `f` is now True. If the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 5, if the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 7, the output state is as described. If the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 7, the output state is as described.***
