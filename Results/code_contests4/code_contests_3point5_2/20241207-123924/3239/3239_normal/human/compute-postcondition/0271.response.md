Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is updated based on conditions related to `a[i]`, `f` and `g` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[11]` is True, `l` appends the value of `g[11]`. If `f[11]` is False, `l` appends the value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 and stored in the list `l`, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
