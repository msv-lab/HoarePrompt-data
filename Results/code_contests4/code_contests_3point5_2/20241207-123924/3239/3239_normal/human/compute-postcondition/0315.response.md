Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `a` is a list of integers. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2, and a[i] % 3 is not equal to 0. The element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 5***
