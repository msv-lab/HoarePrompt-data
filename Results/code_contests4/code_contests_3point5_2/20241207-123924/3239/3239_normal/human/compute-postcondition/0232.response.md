Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, and `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, and `j` is increased by 1**
