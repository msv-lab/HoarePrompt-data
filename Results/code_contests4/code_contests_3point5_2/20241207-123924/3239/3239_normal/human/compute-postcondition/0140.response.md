Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is either [0], [1], [0, 1], or [1, 0], `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. In the if part, if `f[2]` is True, the state remains the same. In the else part, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[2]` is incremented by 1.**
