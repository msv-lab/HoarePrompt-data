The `append` method adds the element `g[1]` to the end of list `l`, which will increase the length of list `l` by 1. The values of `f`, `g`, `j`, `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Since `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `g[1]` is 0. After appending 0 to list `l`, the length of `l` will be 1.

Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3, `l` is a list with one element which is 0**
