Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. In the if part, the value at index 7 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. In the else part, `j` is increased by 1 based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
