Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If f[3] is true, `l` contains the value 0. If f[3] is false, `j` is set to 1, `l` is a list containing the updated value of `j`.**
