Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` is a list containing either 0 or 1 based on the condition. The result of `func_1()` determines whether the loop can execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` satisfies multiple conditions including not being even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, `l` contains the value of `g[6]`. If `f[6]` is false, `l` contains 1.***
