Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, then depending on the value of `f[5]`, different operations are performed on `l` and `g[5]`. If not, various conditions are checked based on `a[i]` modulo different numbers, and the lists `l` and `g` are updated accordingly.***
