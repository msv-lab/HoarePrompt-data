Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` can be [0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], or [0, 2], `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. If `f[10]` is true, the program retains the initial state. If `f[10]` is false, `g` has the value of `j` at index 10.**
