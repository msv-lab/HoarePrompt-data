The code appends the element at index 9 of list `g` to list `l`. Since `g` is a list of 12 zeros, the element at index 9 is 0. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2, `l` contains a single element which is 0.
