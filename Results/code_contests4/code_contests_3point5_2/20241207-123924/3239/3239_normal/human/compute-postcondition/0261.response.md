Example Answer:
`l` appends the value of `g[10]`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `l` appends the value of `g[10]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `l` appends the value of `g[10]`**
