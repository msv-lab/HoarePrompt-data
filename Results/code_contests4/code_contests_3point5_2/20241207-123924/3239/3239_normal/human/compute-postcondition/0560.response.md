Postcondition: ***f and g are lists of 12 zeros, j is either 0, 1, or 2, i is 3, n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If a[i] % 31 == 0 and f[11] is true, l contains the last element of list g. If a[i] % 31 == 0 and f[11] is false, j is either 1, 2, or 3, g has been updated where the last element at index 11 is now equal to j + 1, and l is a list containing the value of j + 1.***
