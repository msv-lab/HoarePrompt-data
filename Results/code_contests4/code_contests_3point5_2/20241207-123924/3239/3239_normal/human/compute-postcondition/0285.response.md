Example Answer:
The function `func_8` is called with the maximum value in list `l` as an argument. The function will evaluate conditions based on the maximum value in `l`, update the lists `f`, `g`, and count the total conditions met in variable `j`. The initial state of the variables `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` is unknown, so the output state will depend on the conditions evaluated within the function.
Output State: **The final state will be based on the conditions evaluated within the function `func_8` for the maximum value in list `l`.**
