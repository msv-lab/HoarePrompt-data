Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] in the if part and [0] or [1, 1] in the else part, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. Additionally, if the if part is executed, `j` remains the same, but if the else part is executed, `j` is incremented by 1 and `g[3]` is equal to the new value of `j`.***
