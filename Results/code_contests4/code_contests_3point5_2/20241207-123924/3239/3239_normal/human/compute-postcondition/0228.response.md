Example Answer:
`g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, but the initial states of `g` and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` contains the updated value of `j` appended to it, and `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.
Output State: **`l` contains the updated value of `j` appended to it, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`**
