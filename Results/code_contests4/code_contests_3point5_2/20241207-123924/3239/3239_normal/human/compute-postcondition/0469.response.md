Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `f[9]` is True, `l` contains a single element which is 0. Otherwise, `l` is a list with the value `j` appended to it and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[9]` is incremented by 1**.
