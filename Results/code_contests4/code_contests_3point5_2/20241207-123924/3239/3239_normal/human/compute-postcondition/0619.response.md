Postcondition: ***`f`, `g`, `l`, `a`, `n`, `j` are all in specific states based on the condition of `f[4]`. If `f[4]` is true, `g` remains a list of 12 zeros, `l` contains one element which is the value of `g[4]`, the loop can execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the elements at index `i` in list `a` satisfy specific conditions. If `f[4]` is false, `f` remains a list of 12 zeros, `g` has 1 at index 4 and zeros elsewhere, `l` has one element which is 1, the loop can execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the elements at index `i` in list `a` satisfy specific conditions.***
