Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `f[1]` is true, `l` is a list with one element which is 0. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1, `l` contains the appended value of the previous `j`, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of the updated `j`. `f[1]` is incremented by 1.**
