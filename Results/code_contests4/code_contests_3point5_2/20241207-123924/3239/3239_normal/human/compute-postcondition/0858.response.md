Output State: **At the end of the loop, `f` and `g` will remain as lists of 12 zeros. `l` will contain elements based on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop. The result of `func_1()` will allow the loop to execute the required number of times. `n` will be the value returned by `func_1()`. `j` will have a final value based on the conditions encountered in the loop. The elements of list `l` will be a combination of elements from list `g` and values of `j` based on the conditions.**
