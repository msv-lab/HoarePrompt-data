Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the element at index 9 of list `g` to list `l`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, element at index 9 of list `g` is appended to list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, element at index 9 of list `g` is appended to list `l`**
