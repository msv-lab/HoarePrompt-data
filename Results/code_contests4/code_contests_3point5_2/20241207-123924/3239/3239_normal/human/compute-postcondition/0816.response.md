Output State: `f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. If `f[6]` is true, `l` now has an additional element which is the value at index 6 of list `g`. If `f[6]` is false, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition, and the value of `j` increased by 1. Additionally, `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[6]` is incremented by 1.
