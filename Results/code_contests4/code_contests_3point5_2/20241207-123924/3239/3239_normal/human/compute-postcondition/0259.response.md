Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[9]` is true, then the element at index 9 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `f[9]` is false, then `l` is appended with the incremented value of `j`, `f` and `g` remain updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
