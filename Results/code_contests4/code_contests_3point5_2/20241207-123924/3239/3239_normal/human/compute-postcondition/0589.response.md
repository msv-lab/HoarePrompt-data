Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `l` is a list containing either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on the condition, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. Depending on the condition, the element at index 1 of list `f` is true or remains zero.***
