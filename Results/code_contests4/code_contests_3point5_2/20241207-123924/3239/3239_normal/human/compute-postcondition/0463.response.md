Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 2 satisfies certain conditions. If `f[8]` is true, `l` contains the element at index 8 of list `g`. If `f[8]` is false, `l` is a list containing the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
