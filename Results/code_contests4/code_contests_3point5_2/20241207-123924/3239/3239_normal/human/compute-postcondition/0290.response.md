Example Answer: 
Since the list `l` is initialized as an empty list, and no operations are performed on it, the final state cannot be determined without knowing the values assigned or operations performed within the functions `func_4`, `func_8`, and `func_1`.
Output State: **The final state cannot be determined without knowing the values assigned or operations performed within the functions `func_4`, `func_8`, and `func_1`.**
