Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `f[7]` is true, `l` is a list containing the value at index 7 of list `g`. If `f[7]` is false, `j` is either 1 or 2, `l` contains the value of `j` appended at the end, and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j` incremented by 1.**
