Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing either [0] or [1], `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a` is a list. The element at index `i` in `a` is not even and divisible by 3. The state of the program after the if else block execution depends on the value of the third element in `f`. If it is true (non-zero), `l` remains [0], else `l` becomes [1]. The element at index 2 in `g` also depends on the condition. If the third element in `f` is true, `g` remains 12 zeros, otherwise, it changes to 1 at index 2. `j` changes based on the condition, either remaining 0 or becoming 1, `f[2]` is incremented by 1.**
