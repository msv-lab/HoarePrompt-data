Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros. If a[i] % 19 == 0, `f` remains as is except for the element at index 8 being 1. If a[i] % 19 != 0, `f` becomes a list of 12 zeros with the 9th element assigned the value of 1. `g` is a list of 12 zeros. If a[i] % 19 == 0, `g` is a list of 11 zeros and 1 at index 8. If a[i] % 19 != 0, `g` is also a list of 12 zeros with the 9th element assigned the value of 1. `l` contains the value 1. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. If a[i] % 23 == 0, `j` is 1 and the element at index `i` in list `a` satisfies specific conditions. If a[i] % 23 != 0, `j` can be either 0 or 1 based on divisibility by 29 and 31.***
