The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the sum of the first n composite integers starting from 4. The function calculates the sum by iterating over composite integers in the range [4, 1000] and adding them to the total sum. The function then returns the final sum as the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns the sum of the first n composite integers starting from 4, where n is a positive integer.**
