Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `f` is a list of 12 zeros except for 1 at index 10 in the if part and 1 at the last index in the else part, `g` is a list of 12 zeros except for 1 at index 10 in the if part and 1 at the last index in the else part, `j` is 1 in both cases, `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2, a[i] % 3 is not equal to 0, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 5, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 7, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 11, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 13, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 17, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 19, the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 23. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 29, `f` has 1 at index 10 and `g` has 1 at index 10, `l` is a list containing the value 1. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 31, the last element of `f` determines the value of `l`, where if True then `l` is 0 and if False then `l` is 1.***
