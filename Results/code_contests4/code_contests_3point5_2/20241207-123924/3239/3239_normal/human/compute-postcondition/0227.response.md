Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of `n`, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are known based on the conditions related to `a[i]` and `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`. Therefore, after executing the code, the list `l` will have the updated value of `j` appended to it.
Output State: **`l` contains the updated value of `j` appended to it**
