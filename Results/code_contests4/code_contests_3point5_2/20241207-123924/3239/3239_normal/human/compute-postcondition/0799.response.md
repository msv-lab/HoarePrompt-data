Example Answer:
The value at index 4 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. Since `g` initially contains 12 zeros, the value at index 4 is 0. Therefore, after execution, `l` contains the element 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `l` contains 0, result of `func_1()` allows one more loop execution, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even.**
