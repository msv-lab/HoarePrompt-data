Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros except the last element which is 1. `g` is a list of 12 zeros except the last element which is 1. `j` is 1. `i` is 1. `n` is greater than 0. `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is divisible by 31. If the last element of `f` is True, `l` is 0. If the last element of `f` is False, `l` is 1***
