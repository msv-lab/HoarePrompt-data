After executing the code snippet `l.append(j)`, the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of `l` are dependent on the conditions evaluated for `a[i]`, and the values of `f` and `g` are dependent on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`. The value of `n` being greater than 0 and `j` being incremented by 1 are not directly affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is updated with the appended value of `j`, `f` and `g` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1**
