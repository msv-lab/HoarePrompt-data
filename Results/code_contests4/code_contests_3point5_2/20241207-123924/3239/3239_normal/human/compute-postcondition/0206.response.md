According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i`, `a[i]`, `l`, `f`, `g`, `j`, and the conditions mentioned. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `n` is greater than 0, `l` can be [0], [0, 0], [1], [1, 0], [1, 1], or [0, 2], `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` can be 0, 1, or 2, `i` is incremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
- Check the value of `a[i]` and update `l` based on the conditions mentioned.
- Update `g[4]` and `f[4]` based on the condition related to `a[i] % 7 == 0`.
- Update `j`, `g[5]`, and `f[5]` based on the condition related to `a[i] % 11 == 0`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`.**
