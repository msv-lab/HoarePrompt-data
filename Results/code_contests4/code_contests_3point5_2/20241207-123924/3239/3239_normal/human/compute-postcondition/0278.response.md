Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. After the execution of the if else block, the values of `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on various conditions related to `a[i]`. Specifically, if `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `f[6]`, and the contents of list `l` include the incremented value of `f[6]`. In the else part, multiple scenarios occur based on the different conditions of `a[i]`. Depending on the specific conditions, elements are appended, updated, or incremented in lists `l`, `f`, and `g`, and `j` is also adjusted accordingly.***
