According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the result of `func_1()`. At the end of the last iteration, `f` is a list of frequencies of numbers divisible by certain numbers in the list `a`, `g` is a list of the last updated values of `j`, and `l` is a list containing values based on the conditions met during the iterations. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the result of `func_1()` must allow the loop to iterate again.
State: **`f` is a list of frequencies of numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 in the list `a`, `g` is a list of the last updated values of `j` for each condition, `l` is a list containing values based on the conditions met during the iterations, for the loop to execute one more time the result of `func_1()` must allow it**
