Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 12 zeros, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a` is a list. The element at index `i` in `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 5. The value at index 3 in list `f` is True, `l` contains the element at index 3 from list `g` which is 0.**
