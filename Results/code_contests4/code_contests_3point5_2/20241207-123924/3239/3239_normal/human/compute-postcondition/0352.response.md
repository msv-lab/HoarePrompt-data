Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and after the if condition, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 13. If `f[6]` is true, `l` contains the value at index 6 of list `g`. If `f[6]` is false, `l` contains the value 1.***
