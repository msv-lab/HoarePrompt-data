Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `f[9]` is True, then `l` has a single element 0. If `f[9]` is False, then `j` is 1, 2, or 3, `l` is a list containing the value of `j`, and `g` is updated such that the 10th element is assigned the value of `j`.**
