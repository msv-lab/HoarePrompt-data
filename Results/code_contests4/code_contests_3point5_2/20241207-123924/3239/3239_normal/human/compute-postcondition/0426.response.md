Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `f[2]` evaluates to True, then `l` contains one element which is 0. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the value of `j` and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
