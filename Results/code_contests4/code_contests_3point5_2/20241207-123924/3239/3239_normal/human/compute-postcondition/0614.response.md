Output State: `f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `l` has one element which is the value of `g[4]`, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even and the element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not divisible by 5. Additionally, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 7. The condition `f[4]` is true.
