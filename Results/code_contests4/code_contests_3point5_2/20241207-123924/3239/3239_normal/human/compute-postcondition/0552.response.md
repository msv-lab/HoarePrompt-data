Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `f[10]` is true, `j` remains the same, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3, and `l` contains the element at index 10 of list `g`. If `f[10]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3, `l` has appended the value of `j`, and `g` at index 10 is assigned the value of `j`.***
