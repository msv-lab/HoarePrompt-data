Example Answer:
The code writes the value popped from 'end' key in `kwargs` to the `file`. If 'end' key is present in `kwargs`, it writes the value associated with 'end' key, otherwise it writes a new line character '\n'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` has at least one element, all elements in `args` have been written to `file` separated by `sep`.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` has at least one element, all elements in `args` have been written to `file` separated by `sep`**
