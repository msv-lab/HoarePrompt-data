Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `f[10]` is true, `l` contains the value of `g` at index 10. Otherwise, `l` contains the value of the incremented `j`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
