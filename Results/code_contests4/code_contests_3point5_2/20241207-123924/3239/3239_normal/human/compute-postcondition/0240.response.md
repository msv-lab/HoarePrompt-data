Example Answer:
`g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `g[6]` will hold the incremented value of `j`. The contents of the list `l` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`, contents of list `l` include the incremented value of `j`**
