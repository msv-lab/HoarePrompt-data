Output State: **n is greater than 0, l is a list containing either 0 or 1, f and g are lists containing 12 zeros, j is either 0 or 1, i is 0, a is a list. If f[8] is true, then the element at index i in a is divisible by 19. If f[8] is false, then the element at index i in a is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, divisible by 17, divisible by 19, and g[8] is assigned the value of j.**
