Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 3 of list `g` or `j` based on the condition in the if part. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. Depending on the condition, the element at index 1 of list `f` is true or remains zero. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13, then various elements of `f` and `g` are updated based on the divisibility conditions of `a[i]`. After the execution of the if else block, `l` contains either the element at index 3 of list `g` if the if part is executed, otherwise it contains `j`. `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[4]` is incremented by 1 if the if part is executed. `f[5]` is incremented by 1 if the if part is executed. `f[6]` is increased by 1 if the if part is executed. `l` contains the element at index 7 of list `g` if the else part is executed, and the value of `j` if the else part is executed. `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j` if the else part is executed. `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[7]` is increased by 1 if the else part is executed.***
