Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is true, `j` remains the same, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` contains the element at index 10 of list `g`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` appends the value of `j`, `g` at index 10 is assigned the value of `j`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is true, `l` contains the last element of list `g`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is false, `j` is either 1, 2, or 3, g has been updated where the last element at index 11 is now equal to j + 1, `l` is a list containing the value of j + 1, and `a` remains unchanged.***
