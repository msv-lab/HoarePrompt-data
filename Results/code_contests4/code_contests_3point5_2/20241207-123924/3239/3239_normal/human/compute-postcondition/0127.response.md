Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with a single 1 at index 11 or a non-zero value at index 2 based on the condition, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 8, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a` is a list. If the element at index `i` in `a` is even, f[1] is incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 3 and the third element in `f` is true, `l` remains [0], else `l` becomes [1]. The element at index 2 in `g` also depends on the condition. If the third element in `f` is true, `g` remains 12 zeros, otherwise, it changes to 1 at index 2. `j` changes based on the condition, either remaining 0 or becoming 1, `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3, the program state after the else block execution depends on the divisibility of the element at index `i` in `a` by 5 or 7 as described.***
