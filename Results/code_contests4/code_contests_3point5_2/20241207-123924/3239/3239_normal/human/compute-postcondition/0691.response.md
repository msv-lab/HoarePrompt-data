Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros except for index 11 which is incremented by 1 if `a[i] % 31 == 0`. `g` remains a list of 12 zeros. `l` contains the value at index 11 of list `g`. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 but is divisible by 31. The last element of list `f` is true if the condition is met, otherwise, it remains false.***
