Output State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros except f[8] which is 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros except g[8] which is 1, `l` contains either the element at index 8 of list `g` or the value of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even, and the loop will execute one more time based on the result of `func_1()`**
