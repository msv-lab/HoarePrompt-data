Output State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and after the if condition, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 13. The condition `f[6]` is true, `l` contains the value at index 6 of list `g`.**
