Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2, `l` contains the value at index 1 of list `g`. If `f[1]` evaluates to True, then no changes occur. If `f[1]` evaluates to False, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
