Output State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `l` is a list containing the value at index 3 of list `g`, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even and not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 5. If `(f[3])` is true, `l` contains the value at index 3 of list `g`. Otherwise, `l` contains 1. The element at index 3 in list `f` is true, and `g[3]` is 1.**
