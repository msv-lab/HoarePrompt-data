Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, l is a list, f is a list containing 11 zeros and a single 1 at index 11, g is a list with 12 zeros, j is either 0 or 1, i is 0, a is a list. The element at index i in a is not even. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 3. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 5. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 7. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 11. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 13. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 17. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 19. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 23. The element at index i in a is not divisible by 29. The element at index i in a is divisible by 31. If the last element of list f is True, then l contains the value at index 11 of list g. If the last element of list f is not True, then the element at index 11 in list g is 1.***
