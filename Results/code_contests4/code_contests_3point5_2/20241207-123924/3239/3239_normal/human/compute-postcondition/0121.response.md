Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, l is a list containing either 0 or 1, f is a list containing 11 zeros and a single 1 at index 11, g is a list with 12 zeros, j is either 0 or 1, i is 0, a is a list. If the element at index i in a is divisible by 19 and f[8] is True, then g[8] is assigned the value of j. If the element at index i in a is not divisible by 19 and f[8] is False, then the element at index i in a is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, divisible by 17, divisible by 19, and g[8] is assigned the value of j. If the last element of list f is True, then l contains the value at index 11 of list g. If the last element of f is not True, then the element at index 11 in list g is 1.***
