Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i]`. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, the value at index 7 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. In the else part, if `a[i] % 19 == 0`, then if `f[8]` is true, `l` appends the value of `g[8]`; otherwise, `l` is updated with the appended value of `j`, `f` and `g` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1, and the 9th element of list `g` is updated with the new value of `j`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, then if `f[9]` is true, the element at index 9 of list `g` is appended to list `l`; if false, `l` is appended with the incremented value of `j`, and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `l` appends the value of `g[10]` if `f[10]` is true, and `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on different conditions after evaluating `a[i` and the values of `f` and `g` are adjusted accordingly.***
