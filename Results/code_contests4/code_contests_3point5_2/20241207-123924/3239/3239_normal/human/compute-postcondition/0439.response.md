Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it if `f[4]` is True. If `f[4]` is False, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` can be either 1 or 2. In either case, `g[4]` will be either 1 or 2. `f[4]` is incremented by 1.**
