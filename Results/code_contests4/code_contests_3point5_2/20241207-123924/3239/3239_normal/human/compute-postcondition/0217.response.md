Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is updated based on the value at index 2 of `g`. If `f[2]` is true, `f` and `g` are updated according to conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, and `j` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[2]` is false, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, while `f` and `g` remain the same.***
