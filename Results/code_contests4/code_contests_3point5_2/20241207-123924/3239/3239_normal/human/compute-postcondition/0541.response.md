Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `f[8]` is true, then `l` contains the element at index 8 of list `g`. Otherwise, `j` is either 1, 2, or 3, `l` contains the appended value of `j`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, `f[8]` is incremented by 1.**
