Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `l` contains the value at index 5 of list `g`, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0. Initially, `j` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even and not divisible by 3, 5, 7, but is divisible by 11. If `f[5]` is true, `l` contains the value at index 5 of list `g`. Otherwise, `g` has the value of `j` at index 5, `l` is [1], and `j` is updated to 1.**
