Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, then based on the conditions specified, `l` and `g` at index 4 are updated accordingly and `f[4]` is incremented. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `a[i] % 31 == 0` are not met, then `l` and `g` are updated based on the specified conditions and `j` is updated accordingly.***
