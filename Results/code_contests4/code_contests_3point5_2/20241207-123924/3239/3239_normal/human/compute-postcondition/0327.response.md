Output State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. After entering the if condition, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 7 when the condition `f[4]` is true, `l` contains the element at index 4 of list `g`.**
