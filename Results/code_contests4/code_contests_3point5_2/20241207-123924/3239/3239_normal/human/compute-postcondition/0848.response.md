Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros; `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 or 2 based on a condition; the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition and has been increased by 1 if f[10] is False; `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. If f[10] is True, `l` now contains the element at index 10 of list `g` appended to it. If f[10] is False, `j` is increased by 1, `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, so now `g[10]` is either 1 or 2, and `l` now contains the appended value of `j`. If f[11] is true, the values remain unchanged. If f[11] is false, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g`, 1, and the incremented value of `j`; `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
