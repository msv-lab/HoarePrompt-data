According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `args` list. 

For the loop to execute:
1. `args` should have at least 1 element.
2. `x` should be assigned the first element in the `args` list.

State: **`sep` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default value of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from kwargs with a default value of sys.stdout, `at_start` is assigned the value True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is assigned the first element in the `args` list**
