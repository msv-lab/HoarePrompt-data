Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with 11 zeros and 1 at index 9, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2, `a[i] % 3` is not equal to 0, element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 5, element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 7, element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 11, element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 13, element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 17, element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 19, element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 23. If `f[9]` is true, then `l` contains the element at index 9 of list `g`. If `f[9]` is false, then `l` contains the value 1.***
