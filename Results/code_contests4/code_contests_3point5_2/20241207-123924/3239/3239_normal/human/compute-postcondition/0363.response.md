Output State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros with the value at index 7 increased by 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros. If f[7] is true, then `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 but divisible by 17. `l` contains the value of `g[7]`. If f[7] is false, then `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 but divisible by 17. `l` is a list containing the value 1.**
