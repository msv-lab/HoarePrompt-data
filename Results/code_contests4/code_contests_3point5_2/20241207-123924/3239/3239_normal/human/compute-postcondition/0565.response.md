Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, the value at index 6 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If `a[i] % 17 == 0` and `f[7]` is True, `l` contains the element at index 7 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 17 == 0` and `f[7]` is False, `l` has the value of `j` appended to it and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is True, then `l` contains the element at index 8 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 19 == 0` and `f[8]` is False, `l` contains the appended value of `j`, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`, `f[8]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is True, `l` has a single element 0. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is False, `l` is a list containing the value of `j`, and `g` is updated such that the 10th element is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is true, `l` contains the element at index 10 of list `g`, `j` remains the same, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` remains unchanged. If `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, `l` appends the value of `j`, `g` at index 10 is assigned the value of `j`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is true, `l` contains the last element of list `g`. If `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is false, g has been updated where the last element at index 11 is now equal to j + 1, `l` is a list containing the value of j + 1, and `a` remains unchanged.***
