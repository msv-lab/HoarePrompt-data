Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` can be 0, 1, or 2. After execution, `j` will be 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3.
