Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with 11 zeros and 1 at index 3, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 2, and `a[i] % 3` is not equal to 0, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 5. If `f[3]` is true, `l` contains the value of `g[3]`. If `f[3]` is false, `l` contains the value 1***
