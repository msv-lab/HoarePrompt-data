Example Answer:
After executing the code `l.append(j)`, the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is increased by 1 based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, and the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is increased by 1 based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, and the value of `j` is appended to the list `l`**
