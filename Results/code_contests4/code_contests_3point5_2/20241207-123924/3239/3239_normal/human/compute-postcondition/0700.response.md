Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with specific values based on the conditions mentioned, `l` contains either 0 or 1 based on the outcomes of the conditions, the result of `func_1()` determines whether the loop can execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` can be either 0 or 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` satisfies multiple conditions including not being even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13. Various elements of `f` and `g` are updated based on the divisibility conditions of `a[i]`.***
