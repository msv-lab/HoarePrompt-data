Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros except the last element which is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, n is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 31. If the last element of `f` is True, `l` is a list containing the value of the last element of `g` which is 0. If the last element of `f` is False, `l` contains the value 1***
