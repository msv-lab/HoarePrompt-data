Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 based on conditions related to `a[i]`, the value of `j` will be incremented and added to the list `l`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` contains the updated value of `j` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same**
