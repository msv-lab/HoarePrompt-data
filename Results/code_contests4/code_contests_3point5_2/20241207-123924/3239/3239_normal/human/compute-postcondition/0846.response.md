Output State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros; `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition; the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition and has been increased by 1; `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. If `f[11]` is true, the values remain unchanged. If `f[11]` is false, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g`, 1, and the incremented value of `j`; `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
