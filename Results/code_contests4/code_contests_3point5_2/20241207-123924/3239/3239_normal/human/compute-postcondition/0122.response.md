Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list, `f` is a list containing 11 zeros and a single 1 at index 11, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a` is a list. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 13, then the 7th element of list `f` is evaluated as True if f[6] is True, otherwise it's evaluated as False. If the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 13, and `f[8]` is True, and the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 19, then `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`. If the element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 13, and `f[8]` is False, and the element at index `i` in `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, divisible by 17, divisible by 19, then `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`. If the last element of list `f` is True, then `l` contains the value at index 11 of list `g`. If the last element of `f` is not True, then the element at index 11 in list `g` is 1.***
