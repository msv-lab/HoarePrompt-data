Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `f[5]` is true, `l` contains the element at index 5 of list `g` appended to it. If `f[5]` is false, `l` contains the value of `j` that was appended, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[5]` is incremented by 1.**
