Output State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. Depending on the condition, the element at index 1 of list `f` is true or remains zero. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13, then various elements of `f` and `g` are updated based on the divisibility conditions of `a[i]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the necessary states should be adjusted accordingly. After the if else block, `l` contains either the element at index 10 of list `g` or the value of `j`. `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[10]` is increased by 1.**
