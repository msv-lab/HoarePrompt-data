Example Answer:
The value at index 2 of list `g` is assigned the value of variable `j`. The previous values of `n`, `l`, `f`, and `g` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, `f` and `g` remain the same**
