Example Answer:
A new value `j` is appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` has been increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated values of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated values of `j`**
