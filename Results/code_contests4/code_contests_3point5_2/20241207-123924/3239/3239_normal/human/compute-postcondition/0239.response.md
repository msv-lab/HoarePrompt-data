Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `l`. Since the initial state mentions that variable `j` is increased by 1, the value of `j` is incremented by 1 before being appended to `l`. Therefore, after execution, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, contents of list `l` include the incremented value of `j`**
