Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` can be [0], [1, 0], [1, 1], or [0, 2], `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` can be 0, 1, or 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. If `f[9]` is True, then the program executes the if part where `f[8]` is incremented by 1 and `g[8]` is equal to `j`. Otherwise, the program executes the else part where `l` is updated to [0, 0] or [1, 1], and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`, `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `f[10]` is true, the program retains the initial state. If `f[10]` is false, `g` has the value of `j` at index 10. If the if condition is not met, `l` is either [0] or [1, 1], `f[11]` is incremented by 1, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `g` has index 11 assigned the value of `j` after the execution of the if else block.***
