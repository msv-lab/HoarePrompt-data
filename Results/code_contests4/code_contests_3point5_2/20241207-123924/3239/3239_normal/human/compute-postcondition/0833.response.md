Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition and the value of `j`. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. If the condition in the if statement is true, `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`. If the condition is false, `j` is incremented by 1 and the value at index 9 of list `g` is updated to `j`.***
