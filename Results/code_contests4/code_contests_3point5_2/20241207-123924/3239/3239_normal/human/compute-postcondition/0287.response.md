According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_1()`. If the return value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop executed based on the conditions evaluated within the function `func_8` for the maximum value in list `l`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
State: **Output State: The final state will be based on the conditions evaluated within the function `func_8` for the maximum value in list `l`, for the loop to execute one more time the return value of `func_1()` must be greater than 0**
