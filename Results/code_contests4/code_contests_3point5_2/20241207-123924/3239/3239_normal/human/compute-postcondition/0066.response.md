Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing 1, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros where the 6th element is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `a` is a list. The element at index `i` in `a` is not even. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 3. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 5. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 7. The element at index `i` in `a` is not divisible by 11. The element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 13. The 7th element of list `f` is evaluated as True if f[6] is True, otherwise it's evaluated as False.**
