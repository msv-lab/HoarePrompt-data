Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[3]` is true, `l` has appended the element at index 3 of list `g`. If `f[3]` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[3]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
