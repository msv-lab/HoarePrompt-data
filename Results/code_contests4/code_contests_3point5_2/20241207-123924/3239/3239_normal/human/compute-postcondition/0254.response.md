Example Answer:
The value of the 8th element of list `f` is incremented by 1. The previous value of the 8th element of list `f` is unknown, so after execution, the 8th element of list `f` is increased by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[8]` is true, `l` appends the value of `g[8]`. Otherwise, `l` is updated with the appended value of `j`, `f` and `g` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1, and the 9th element of list `g` is updated with the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[8]` is true, `l` appends the value of `g[8]`. Otherwise, `l` is updated with the appended value of `j`, `f` and `g` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1, and the 9th element of list `g` is updated with the new value of `j`.**
