Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 4 of list `g` if the condition in the if part is true, otherwise it contains `j`. After the execution of the if else block, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[4]` is incremented by 1 if the if part is executed. `f[5]` is incremented by 1 if the if part is executed. `f[6]` is increased by 1 if the if part is executed. `l` will contain the element at index 7 of list `g` if the if part is executed, and the value of `j` if the else part is executed. `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j` if the else part is executed. `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[7]` is increased by 1 if the else part is executed.***
