Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains the element at index 3 of list `g` or 1 based on conditions involving `j` and `a[i]`. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on conditions. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, `l` now contains the element at index 2 of list `g` appended to it. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `l` now contains the element at index 3 of list `g` in addition to its previous elements. If `a[i] % 7 == 0` or `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 5 of list `g` plus 1 and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 6 of list `g` appended to it. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 7 of list `g` appended to it. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 8 of list `g` appended to it. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 9 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 23 != 0` and `f[11]` is true, the values remain unchanged. If not, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g`, 1, and the incremented value of `j`. In all other cases, `l` contains the element at index 5 of list `g` plus 1 or the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 or 2 based on conditions involving `j`.***
