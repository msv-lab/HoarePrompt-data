Example Answer:
`g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `j` is increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `g[1]` will contain the updated value of `j`. The state of other variables is not affected.
Output State: **variable `j` is increased by 1, list `l` contains the updated values of `j`**
