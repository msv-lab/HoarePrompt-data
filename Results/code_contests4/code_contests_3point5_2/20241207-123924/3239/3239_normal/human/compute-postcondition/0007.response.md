Example Answer: 
`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. The value of `x` is the first element in the `args` list. If the condition (not at_start) is true, `file` writes the value of `sep`, which is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of ' '. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is assigned the first element in the `args` list, if the condition (not at_start) is true, `file` writes the value of `sep`.
Output State: **`sep` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of ' ', `file` is assigned the value popped from `kwargs` with a default value of `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, `args` has at least 1 element, `x` is assigned the first element in the `args` list, if the condition (not at_start) is true, `file` writes the value of `sep`**
