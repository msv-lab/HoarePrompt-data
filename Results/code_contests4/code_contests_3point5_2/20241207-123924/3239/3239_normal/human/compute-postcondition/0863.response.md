Functionality: **The function `func_7` iterates over a list `a` of composite integers and categorizes them based on their divisibility by certain numbers. It updates frequency and last updated values in lists `f` and `g` respectively. It then generates a list `l` based on the conditions met during the iteration. Finally, it calls functions `func_8(max(l))` and `func_8(*l)`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
