Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `f[5]` is true, `l` contains the value at index 5 of list `g`. If `f[5]` is false, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it and `g` at index 5 is either 0 or 1.***
