Output State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros except for index 11 which is incremented by 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `l` contains the value at index 11 of list `g`, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, and not divisible by 13, `a[i]` is not divisible by 17, `a[i]` is not divisible by 19. Additionally, `a[i]` is not divisible by 23, and `a[i]` is not divisible by 29. Moreover, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 31. The last element of list `f` is true if the condition is met, otherwise it is not true.**
