The code appends the value of `g` at index 2 to list `l`. Since `g` is a list of 12 zeros, the value at index 2 is 0. Therefore, after execution, `l` will contain one element which is 0. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2, `l` contains one element which is 0**
