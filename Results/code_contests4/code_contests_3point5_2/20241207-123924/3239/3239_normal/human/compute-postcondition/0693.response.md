Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros with the 9th element assigned the value of 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros with the 9th element assigned the value of 1, `l` contains the value 1, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, then `j` is 1 and the element at index `i` in list `a` satisfies specific conditions. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, then based on divisibility by 29 and 31, `f` is updated and `j` can be either 0 or 1***
