Example Answer:
Since `l` is a list and we are appending the value at index 2 of list `g` to `l`, the value at index 2 of `g` is added to the end of list `l`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` is updated to include the value at index 2 of `g`, `f` and `g` are based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is updated to include the value at index 2 of `g`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`**
