Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` can be [0], [0, 0], [1], [1, 0], [1, 1], or [0, 2], `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` can be 0, 1, or 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. If `a[i] % 2 == 0`, `l` is either [0] or [1, 0] in the if part and [0, 0] or [1, 1] in the else part. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, the state remains the same. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, `l` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0]. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `g[4]` remains the same or is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[4]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i] % 7 == 0` is false. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `l` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] or [0, 0] or [1, 1], `j` is assigned the value of 0 or 1, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[5]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i] % 11 == 0` is false.***
