Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `a[i] % 2 == 0`, then based on the value of `f[1]`, `l` and `g[1]` are updated accordingly. If `f[1]` evaluates to False, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 2 != 0`, then based on the divisibility of `a[2]` by 3, `l`, `g`, and `f` are updated based on the specified conditions.***
