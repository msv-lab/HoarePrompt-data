Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros. If a[i] % 17 == 0, `f` is a list with 11 zeros and 1 at index 7. If a[i] % 17 != 0, `f` remains the same. `g` is a list containing 1 at index 7. If a[i] % 17 == 0, `g` remains the same. If a[i] % 17 != 0, `g` is a list of 12 zeros with the 9th element assigned the value of 1. `l` is a list containing 1. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. If a[i] % 19 == 0, `j` is 1 and the element at index `i` in list `a` satisfies specific conditions. If a[i] % 19 != 0, `j` can be either 0 or 1 based on divisibility by 23, 29, and 31.***
