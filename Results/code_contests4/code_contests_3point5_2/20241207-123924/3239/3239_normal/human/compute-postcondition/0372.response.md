Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with the value of 1 at index 8, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with specific conditions mentioned for the element at index `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `g[8]`. After the execution of the if else block, the program state will be such that either the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 19 and `f[8]` is true or `g` will have the value of 1 at index 8 and all other variables retain their respective initial conditions.***
