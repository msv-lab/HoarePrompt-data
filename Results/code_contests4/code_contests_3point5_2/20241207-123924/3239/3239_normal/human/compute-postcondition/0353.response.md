Output State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros with `f[6]` incremented by 1, `g` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with the element at index `i` divisible by 13, `l` contains the value at index 6 of list `g` since `f[6]` is true.**
