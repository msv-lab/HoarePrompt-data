Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `a[2]` is divisible by 3, then based on the value of `f[2]`, `l` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, based on the value of `j`, `l` is updated and `g[2]` is assigned the value of `j`, `f[2]` is incremented by 1. If `a[2]` is not divisible by 3, `l`, `g`, and `f` are updated based on the specified conditions.***
