Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i]`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `l` appends the value of `g[10]` if `f[10]`, and `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, `f[11]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on different conditions after evaluating `a[i]` and the values of `f` and `g` are adjusted accordingly.***
