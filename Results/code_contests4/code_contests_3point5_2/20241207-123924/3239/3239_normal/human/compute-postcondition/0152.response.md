Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] in the if part and [0, 0] or [1, 1] in the else part, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. If the condition in if part is true, the function executes without changing `g[4]`. If the condition in the else part is true, then `j` is assigned to `g[4` where `f[4]` is incremented by 1.**
