Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, then based on the condition of `f[6]`, `l` contains the element at index 6 of list `g` if `f[6]` is true. If `f[6]` is false, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, then based on the conditions of `f[7]`, `l` and `g[7]` are updated accordingly. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, then based on the conditions of `f[8]`, `l` and `g[8]` are updated accordingly. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, then based on the conditions of `f[9]`, `l` and `g[9]` are updated, and `f[9]` is incremented. If `a[i] % 29 == 0`, then based on the conditions of `f[10]`, `l` and `g[10]` are updated, and `f[10]` is incremented. If `a[i] % 31 == 0`, then based on the conditions of `f[11]`, `l` and `g[11]` are updated, and `f[11]` is set to 1. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `j` and `l` are updated accordingly based on the specified conditions.***
