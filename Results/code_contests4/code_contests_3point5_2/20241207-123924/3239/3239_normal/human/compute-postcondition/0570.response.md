Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `a[i] % 2 == 0`, then based on the condition of `f[1]`, `l` contains either 0 or the updated value of `j` depending on the if part. `f[1]` and `g[1]` are incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 3 == 0`, `f[2]` is incremented by 1 and `l` is updated accordingly with the value of `g[2]` or the new value of `j`. If `a[i] % 5 == 0`, based on the condition of `f[3]`, `l` contains either 0 or the updated value of `j`. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, based on the condition of `f[4]`, `l` is appended with the value of the element at index 4 of list `g` or the value of `j`. For `a[i] % 11 == 0`, further operations are performed on `l` and `g[5]` based on the value of `f[5]`. In the else part, `g` is updated with the value of `j` at index 4 and `f[4]` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if else block, the program variables are in the specified state based on the conditions met and the operations performed.***
