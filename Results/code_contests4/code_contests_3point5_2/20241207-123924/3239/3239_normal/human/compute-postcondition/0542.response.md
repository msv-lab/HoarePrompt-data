Example Answer: 
The value of `g[9]` is appended to list `l`. Since `g` is a list of 12 zeros, the value at index 9 is 0. Therefore, after execution, `l` will have a single element which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3, `l` has a single element 0**
