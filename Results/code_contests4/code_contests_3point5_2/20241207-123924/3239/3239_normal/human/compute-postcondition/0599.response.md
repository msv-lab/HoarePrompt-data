Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list with 11 zeros and 1 at index 2, `l` is a list containing 1, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, the element at index `i` in list `a` is divisible by 3. If `f[2]` is true, the state remains the same as before the if else block. If `f[2]` is false, `j` is updated to 1 and `g` has 1 at index 2.***
