Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. After the execution of the if else block, the variables `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i]`. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `f[6]` is incremented by 1, `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `f[6]`, and the contents of list `l` include the incremented value of `f[6]`. In the else part, various scenarios occur based on different conditions of `a[i]`, resulting in adjustments to the lists and variables as specified above.***
