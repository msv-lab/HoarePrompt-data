Output State: At the end of the loop, `f` will be a list of frequencies of numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 in the list `a`. `g` will be a list of the last updated values of `j` for each condition. `l` will be a list containing values based on the conditions met during the iterations. `n` will be the value returned by `func_1()`. `j` will have a final value based on the conditions encountered in the loop. The elements of list `l` will be a combination of elements from list `g` and values of `j` based on the conditions. The functions `func_8(max(l))` and `func_8(*l)` will be called at the end of the loop.
