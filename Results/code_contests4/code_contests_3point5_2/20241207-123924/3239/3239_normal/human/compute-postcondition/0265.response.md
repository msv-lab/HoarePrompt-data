Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i]`, `l` appends the value of `g[10]` if `f[10]`. If not, `l` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is appended to the list `l`, and `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
