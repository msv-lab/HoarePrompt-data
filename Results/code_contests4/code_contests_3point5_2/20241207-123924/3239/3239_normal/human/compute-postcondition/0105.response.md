Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, l is a list containing either 0 or 1, f and g are lists containing 12 zeros, j is either 0 or 1, i is 0, a is a list. If f[10] is true, then the element at index i in a is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, not divisible by 19, divisible by 23 and divisible by 29. If f[10] is false, then the element at index i in a is divisible by 29.***
