Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `a[2]` is divisible by 5, `l` is updated based on the conditions specified. If `f[3]`, then `l` is a list containing the value at index 3 of list `g`. If not `f[3]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `j` appended to it and `g[3]` is equal to the value of `j`. After executing the code snippet, the value at index 3 of list `f` is incremented by 1. If `a[2]` is not divisible by 5, `l` and `g` are updated based on the specified conditions. If `a[2]` is divisible by 7, `l` and `g` at index 4 are updated accordingly and `f[4]` is incremented. If `a[2]` is not divisible by 7, `l` and `g` are updated based on the specified conditions and `j` is updated accordingly.***
