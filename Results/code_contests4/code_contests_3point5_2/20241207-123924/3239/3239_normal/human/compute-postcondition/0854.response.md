Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros; `l` contains either the element at index 5 of list `g` plus 1 or the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 or 2 based on a condition; the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition; `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 5 of list `g` plus 1 and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 5 of list `g` plus 1 and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, `l` contains the element at index 6 of list `g` appended to it; if not, `l` contains the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition, `j` is increased by 1, `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[6]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 17 == 0`, `l` now contains the element at index 7 of list `g` appended to it; otherwise, `f[7]` is true, `l` contains the element at index 1 of list `g` appended to it, and `j` is increased by 1. If `a[i] % 19 == 0`, `l` now contains the element at index 8 of list `g` appended to it; if not, `f[8]` is true, `l` contains the element at index 1 of list `g` appended to it, `j` is increased by 1, and `g[8]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `a[i] % 23 == 0`, `l` appends the element at index 9 of list `g`; if not, `f[10]` is True, `l` contains the element at index 10 of list `g` appended to it; if `f[10]` is False, `j` is increased by 1, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `l` now contains the appended value of `j`. If `a[i] % 23 != 0` and `f[11]` is true, the values remain unchanged; if not, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g`, 1, and the incremented value of `j`, `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
