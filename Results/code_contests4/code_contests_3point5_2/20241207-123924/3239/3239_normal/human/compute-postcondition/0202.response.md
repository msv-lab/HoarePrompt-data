Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` can be [0], [0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], or [0, 2], `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` can be 0, 1, or 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. If the condition `a[i] % 7 == 0` is true, the function executes without changing `g[4]`. If the condition `a[i] % 7 == 0` is false, then based on the value of `j` (0, 1, or 2), `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j` and `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If the condition `a[i] % 11 == 0` is met in the else part, `l` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0], `j` is either 0 or 1, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`. After execution, `f[5]` is incremented by 1. If the condition `a[i] % 11 == 0` is not met, `l` is either [0, 0] or [1, 1], `j` is either 1 or 2, `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[5]` is incremented by 1.***
