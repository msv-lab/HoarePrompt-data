According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. 

Before the loop starts, the result of `func_1()` must allow the loop to execute one more time, so `n` should be greater than 0. Also, `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `l` is an empty list, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
