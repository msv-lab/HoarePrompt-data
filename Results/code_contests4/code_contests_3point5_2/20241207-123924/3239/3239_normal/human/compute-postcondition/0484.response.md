Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is True, `l` contains a single element which is 0. If `a[i] % 23 == 0` and `f[9]` is False, `l` is a list with the value `j` appended to it and `g[9]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[9]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 23 != 0`, the conditions are checked for `a[i] % 29 == 0`, `a[i] % 31 == 0`. If `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is True, `l` contains the value of `g` at index 10. If `a[i] % 29 == 0` and `f[10]` is False, `l` contains the incremented value of `j`, `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `f[10]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 29 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is True, `l` contains the last element of list `g`. If `a[i] % 29 != 0` and `a[i] % 31 == 0` and `f[11]` is False, `j` is either 1 or 2, `l` contains the value of `j` appended at the end, and `g[11]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[11]` is 1.***
