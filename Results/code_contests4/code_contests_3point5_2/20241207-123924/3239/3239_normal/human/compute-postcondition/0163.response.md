Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` can be either [0, 0] or [1, 0] in the if part, and [0, j] or [1, j] in the else part, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. If the condition `f[6]` is true, the state remains the same. If the condition `f[6]` is false, `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
