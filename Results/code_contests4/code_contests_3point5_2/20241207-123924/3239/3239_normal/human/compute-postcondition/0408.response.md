Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists containing 12 zeros. If a[i] % 17 == 0, then f is updated with the value at index 7 increased by 1, and g remains unchanged. If f[7] is true, then j is 0, i is 1, n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 but divisible by 17, and l contains the value of g[7]. If f[7] is false, then j is 1, i is 1, n is greater than 0, a is a list of integers where the element at index i is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 but divisible by 17, and l is a list containing the value 1. If a[i] is not divisible by 17, and the conditions for 29 or 31 are met, f and g are updated accordingly, and l takes the appropriate value. Otherwise, f and g remain unchanged, j is 1, i remains 1, n is greater than 0, and the conditions for the element at index i in a remain unchanged.***
