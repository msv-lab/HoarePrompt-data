Postcondition: ***`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. If `f[4]` is true, `l` contains 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, the result of `func_1()` allows one more loop execution, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. If `f[4]` is false, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition, `j` is appended, `j` is increased by 1, `g[4]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
