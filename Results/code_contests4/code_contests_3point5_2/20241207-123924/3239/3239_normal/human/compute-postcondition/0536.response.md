The code appends the element at index 8 of list `g` to list `l`. Since the initial state does not mention list `l`, the final state will include list `l` containing the element at index 8 of list `g`.
Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3, `l` contains the element at index 8 of list `g`**
