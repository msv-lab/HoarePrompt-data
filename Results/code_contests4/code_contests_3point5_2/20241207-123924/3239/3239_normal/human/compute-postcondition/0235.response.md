Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[5]` is True, `g[5]` is appended to list `l`. If `f[5]` is False, `j` is increased by 1, `l` contains the updated value of `j`, and `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
