Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`. If `f[6]`, then the value at index 6 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If not `f[6]`, `j` is increased by 1, `g[6]` holds the incremented value of `j`, and the contents of list `l` include the incremented value of `j`.***
