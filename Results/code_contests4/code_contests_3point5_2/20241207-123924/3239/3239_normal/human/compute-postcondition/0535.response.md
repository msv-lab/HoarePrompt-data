Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `f[7]` is True, `l` contains the element at index 7 of list `g`. If `f[7]` is False, `l` has the value of `j` appended to it and `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`.**
