Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If the condition in the if part is true, the value at index 6 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. If the condition in the else part is executed, `l` contains the appended value of `j` and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[6]` is increased by 1.**
