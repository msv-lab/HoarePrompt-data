Output State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `l` contains either the element at index 5 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. In the if part, `l` contains the element at index 5 of list `g` plus 1 in addition to its previous elements. In the else part, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition, `j` is increased by 1, `g[5]` is equal to `j`.**
