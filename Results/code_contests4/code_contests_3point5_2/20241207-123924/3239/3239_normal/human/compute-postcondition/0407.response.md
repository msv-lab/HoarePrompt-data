Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists containing 12 zeros. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 29, then both `f` and `g` have 1 at index 10 and `l` is a list containing 1. If the element at index `i` in `a` is divisible by 31, the last element of `f` determines the value of `l`, where if True then `l` is 0 and if False then `l` is 1. In all other cases, `f` and `g` have 1 at the last index and `l` is a list containing 1. `j` is 1, `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the conditions for the element at index `i` in `a` remain unchanged.***
