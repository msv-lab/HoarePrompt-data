Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, then `f` is updated with the 4th element set to 1, `g` is updated with the 4th element set to 1, `j` is set to 1, `i` is set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is divisible by 7, and `l` contains the value 1. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, then `f` is updated with the value at index 5 set to True and `l` contains the value at index 5 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 13 == 0`, then `f` is updated with the value at index 6 incremented by 1, `g` is updated to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `j` is set to 1, `i` is set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is divisible by 13, and `l` contains the value at index 6 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 13 != 0` and `a[i] % 17 == 0`, then if `f[7]` is true, `f` is updated with the value at index 7 incremented by 1, `j` is set to 0, `i` is set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 but divisible by 17, and `l` contains the value at index 7 of list `g`. If `f[7]` is false, `f` and `g` remain unchanged, `j` is set to 1, `i` is set to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `i` is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 but divisible by 17, and `l` is a list containing the value 1. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 17 and other conditions are met, `f` and `g` are updated accordingly, and `l` takes the appropriate value. Otherwise, `f` and `g` remain unchanged, `j` is set to 1, `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the conditions for the element at index `i` in `a` remain unchanged.***
