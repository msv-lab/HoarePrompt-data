Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list, the element at index `i` in `a` is even. If `f[1]` evaluates to True, `l` contains the value at index 1 from list `g`. Otherwise, `f` remains a list of 12 zeros, `g` has 1 at index 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list, the element at index `i` in `a` is even, and `l` contains the value 1.***
