Output State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is increased by 1. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even. `j` is now either 1 or 2 based on the condition. `g[10]` is assigned the value of `j`, so now `g[10]` is either 1 or 2. `l` now contains the appended value of `j`, so `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 or 2 based on a condition.**
