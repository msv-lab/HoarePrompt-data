Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `l`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 based on previous conditions related to `a[i]`, so the appended value in the list `l` will be one higher than the previous value of `j`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1 based on previous conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `j` is appended to the list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1 based on previous conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `j` is appended to the list `l`**
