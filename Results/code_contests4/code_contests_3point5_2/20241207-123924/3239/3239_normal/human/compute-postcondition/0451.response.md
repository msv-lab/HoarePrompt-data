Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 2. If `f[6]` is true, `l` contains the element at index 6 of list `g`. If `f[6]` is false, `l` contains the value of `j` appended to it, and `g[6]` is assigned the value of `j`. `f[6]` is incremented by 1.**
