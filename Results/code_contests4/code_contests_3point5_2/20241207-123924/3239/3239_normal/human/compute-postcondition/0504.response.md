Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `f[2]` is true, `l` contains the value at index 2 of list `g`. If `f[2]` is false, `l` is a list containing the value of `j` appended at the end, and `g` has the value of `j` at index 2.***
