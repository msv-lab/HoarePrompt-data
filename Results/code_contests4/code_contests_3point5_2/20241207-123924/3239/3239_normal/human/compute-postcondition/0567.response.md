Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros, `j` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index 3. If `a[i] % 7 == 0`, then based on the condition of `f[4]`, either the value of the element at index 4 of list `g` or the value of `j` is appended to `l`. In the else part, `g` is a list of 12 zeros with the value of `j` at index 4, and `f[4]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] % 11 == 0`, further operations are performed on `l` and `g[5]` based on the value of `f[5]`. Otherwise, different conditions are checked based on `a[i]` modulo different numbers, updating `l` and `g` as necessary.***
