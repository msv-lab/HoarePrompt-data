Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `l` contains either 0 or 1 based on specific conditions, the result of `func_1()` determines whether the loop can execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` can be either 0 or 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` satisfies multiple conditions including not being even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13. If a[i] % 5 == 0, the element at index 3 of `f` is true and `g[3]` is 1. If a[i] % 7 == 0, the value at index 4 of `f` is incremented by 1. If a[i] % 13 == 0 and `f[6]` is true, `l` contains the value of `g[6]`. If a[i] % 13 == 0 and `f[6]` is false, `l` contains 1. If a[i] % 13 != 0 and a[i] % 17 == 0, `f` is a list with 11 zeros and 1 at index 7. If a[i] % 13 != 0 and a[i] % 17 != 0, `f` remains the same. If a[i] % 13 != 0 and a[i] % 17 == 0, `g` is a list containing 1 at index 7. If a[i] % 13 != 0 and a[i] % 17 != 0, `g` is a list of 12 zeros with the 9th element assigned the value of 1. If a[i] % 13 != 0 and a[i] % 19 == 0, `j` is 1 and the element at index `i` in list `a` satisfies specific conditions. If a[i] % 13 != 0 and a[i] % 19 != 0, `j` can be either 0 or 1 based on divisibility by 23, 29, and 31.***
