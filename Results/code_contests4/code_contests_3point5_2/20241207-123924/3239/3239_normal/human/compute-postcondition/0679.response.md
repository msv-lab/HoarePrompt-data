Postcondition: ***`f` is a list of 12 zeros, `g` is a list of 12 zeros, `l` has one element which is the value of `g[10]`, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1. The element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, not divisible by 5, not divisible by 7, not divisible by 11, not divisible by 13, not divisible by 17, not divisible by 19, not divisible by 23, not divisible by 29. If `f[10]` is true, then `a[i]` is divisible by 29 and `f[10]` is true. If `f[10]` is false, then `g` is updated where the element at index 10 is now `j`, `l` is a list containing the value `j`, and `j` is incremented by 1.***
