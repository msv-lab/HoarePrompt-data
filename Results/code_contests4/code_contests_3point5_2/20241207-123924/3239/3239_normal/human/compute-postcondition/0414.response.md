Postcondition: ***`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros. Depending on the conditions in the if-else block, specific values may be updated at certain indices. `j` can be either 0 or 1 based on the conditions. `i` is set to 1. `n` is greater than 0. `a` is a list of integers where certain conditions are met for the element at index `i`. If `a[i]` is divisible by 3, `f` is updated with `f[2]` set to 1, `g` is updated to contain [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and `l` is set to [1]. If `a[i]` is not divisible by 3, `f` and `g` remain as lists of 12 zeros, `j` remains as 1, and `l` can have varying values based on different conditions.***
