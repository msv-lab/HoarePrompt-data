Output State: **`f` is a list of 12 zeros except for index 9 which is now 1, `g` is a list of 12 zeros except for index 9 which is now equal to the value of `j`, `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition, the result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition, `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even, depending on the condition the element at index 1 of list `f` is true or remains zero.**
