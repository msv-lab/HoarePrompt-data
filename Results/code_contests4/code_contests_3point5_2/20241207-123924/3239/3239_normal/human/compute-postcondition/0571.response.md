Output State: **`f` and `g` are lists of 12 zeros. The value of `j` is the total number of times the conditions inside the loop were met. The final values of `f` represent the frequency of occurrences of numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 in the list `a`. The final values of `g` store the last updated value of `j` for each condition. The final state of `l` will be a list containing values based on the conditions met during the iterations.**
