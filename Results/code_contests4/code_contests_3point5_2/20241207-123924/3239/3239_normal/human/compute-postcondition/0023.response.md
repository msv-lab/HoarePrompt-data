Postcondition: ***`sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `args` are assigned values from `kwargs` with default values. All elements in `args` have been written to `file` separated by `sep`. If 'flush' key exists in `kwargs` and its value is True, then 'flush' key is popped from `kwargs` with a default value of False.***
