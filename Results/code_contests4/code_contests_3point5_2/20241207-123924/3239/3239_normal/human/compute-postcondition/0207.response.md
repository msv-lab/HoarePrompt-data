Example Answer: 
The value at index 1 of list `g` is appended to list `l`. The variables `n`, `f`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `l` is updated after appending `g[1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `l` contains the value at index 1 of list `g`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `l` contains the value at index 1 of list `g`**
