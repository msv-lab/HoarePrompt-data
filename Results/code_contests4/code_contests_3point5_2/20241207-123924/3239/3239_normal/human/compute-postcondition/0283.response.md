Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. After the execution of the if else block, the variables `l`, `f`, `g`, and `j` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i]`. If `a[i] % 2 == 0` and `f[1]` is true, `l` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` are updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is updated based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, and `l` contains the value at index 1 of list `g`. If `a[i] % 2 == 0` and `f[1]` is false, `j` is increased by 1, and list `l` contains the updated values of `j`. If `a[i] % 2 != 0`, various scenarios occur in the else part based on different conditions of `a[i`, resulting in adjustments to the lists and variables as specified above.***
