According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `n`, `j`, `a`, `f`, `g`, and `l`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros
- `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition
- The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time
- `n` is greater than 0
- `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition
- `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even
- Depending on the condition, the element at index 1 of list `f` is true or remains zero
- If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not even, not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, but divisible by 13, then various elements of `f` and `g` are updated based on the divisibility conditions of `a[i]`
- After the execution of the if else block, `l` contains the element at index 1 of list `g` in the if part and the value of `j` in the else part
- `g[1]` is assigned the value of `j` in the else part
- `f[1]` is increased by 1 if the if part is executed
- `f[4]`, `f[5`, `f[6]` are incremented by 1 if the if part is executed
- `l` contains the element at index 7 of list `g` if the else part is executed, and the value of `j` if the else part is executed
- `g[5]` is assigned the value of `j` if the else part is executed
- `g[7]` is assigned the value of `j`
- `f[7]` is increased by 1 if the else part is executed

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`f`, `g` are lists of 12 zeros. `l` contains either the element at index 1 of list `g` or 1 based on a condition. The result of `func_1()` allows the loop to execute one more time. `n` is greater than 0. `j` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. `a` is a list such that the element at index `i` is even.**
