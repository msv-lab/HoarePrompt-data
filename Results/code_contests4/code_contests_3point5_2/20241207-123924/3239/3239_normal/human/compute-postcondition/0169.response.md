Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] for the if part and [0, 0] or [1, 1] for the else part, `f` is a list containing 12 zeros with modifications based on the conditions, `g` is a list containing 12 zeros or 1 at index 2 based on the condition, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list. In the if part, the program updates the values based on the if condition. In the else part, the program updates the values based on the else condition, increments `j` by 1, and sets `g[7]` equal to `j`.***
