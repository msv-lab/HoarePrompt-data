Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables `n`, `l`, `f`, `g` remain the same as they are not directly affected by the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` based on conditions after evaluating `a[i]`, `f` and `g` updated based on conditions related to `a[i] % 7` and `a[i] % 11`, `j` is incremented by 1**
