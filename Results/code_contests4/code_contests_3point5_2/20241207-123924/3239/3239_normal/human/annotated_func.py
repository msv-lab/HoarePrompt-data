#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. Each composite number a_i in the sequence is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000.**
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 prompts the user to input an integer and returns that integer as the output. The function does not have any specific constraints on the input integer other than being an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- a_i is a composite integer such that 4 <= a_i <= 1000.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input value as it is without any modification
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and simply returns the input value without any modification. It does not perform any specific operations on the input value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- Each a_i is a composite integer such that 4 <= a_i <= 1000.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3() reads input from the user, splits it, and returns a map object containing integers. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `n` as indicated in the annotations. The annotations mention specific constraints on `t`, `n`, and `a_i`, but these constraints are not utilized in the actual function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function func_3(). The specific content of the returned list will depend on the implementation of func_3().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_3()`. The content of the returned list is dependent on the implementation of `func_3()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It redirects the standard input and output to 'input.txt' and 'output.txt' respectively. This function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is simply to perform file redirection for input and output.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` holds the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` must be 0. It then calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `x` and `y` when `y` is 0. The function effectively implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**:

The elements of list `l` will be a combination of elements from list `g` and values of `j` based on the conditions. The functions `func_8(max(l))` and `func_8(*l)` will be called at the end of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` iterates over a list `a` of composite integers and categorizes them based on their divisibility by certain numbers. It updates frequency and last updated values in lists `f` and `g` respectively. It then generates a list `l` based on the conditions met during the iteration. Finally, it calls functions `func_8(max(l))` and `func_8(*l)`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It processes and writes elements from the `args` list to the `file` stream separated by the `sep` value. It then writes the 'end' value to the `file` stream and flushes the stream if the 'flush' key is present and set to True in the `kwargs` dictionary. However, the function lacks the initial definition of `args` and does not calculate the sum of composite integers as indicated in the annotations.
