The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It processes and writes elements from the `args` list to the `file` stream separated by the `sep` value. It then writes the 'end' value to the `file` stream and flushes the stream if the 'flush' key is present and set to True in the `kwargs` dictionary. However, the function lacks the initial definition of `args` and does not calculate the sum of composite integers as indicated in the annotations.
