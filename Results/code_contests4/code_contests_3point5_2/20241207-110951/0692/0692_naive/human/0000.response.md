Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of days with a bad price. The issue is that the inner loop always starts from index 1, which means it is comparing the current price with prices that come after it, not before it. This will lead to incorrect results as it is not checking if a lower price occurs after the current day.

Example:
Input
```
1
5
5 2 4 3 6
```
Output
```
3
```
Expected Output
```
4
```

Explanation:
In this case, the correct number of days with a bad price is 4, which are days 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, the program will incorrectly output 3 as it does not account for all days where a lower price occurs later.
