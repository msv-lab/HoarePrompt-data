#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 150000 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6.**
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                days += 1
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` is the total number of pairs where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j` for all valid pairs in the list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the length of the list is between 1 and 150000, and each element falls between 1 and 10^6. The function iterates through the list to count the number of pairs where an element at a lower index is greater than an element at a higher index. However, the function does not return any specific value.
