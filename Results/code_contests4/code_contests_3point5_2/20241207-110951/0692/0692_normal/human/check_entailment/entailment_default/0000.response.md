Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` iterates through the list to count the number of pairs where an element at a lower index is greater than an element at a higher index. However, the problem description states that Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. This means that the code should only compare an element with elements that come after it, not all elements in the list as the code currently does. This discrepancy makes the code incorrect.
