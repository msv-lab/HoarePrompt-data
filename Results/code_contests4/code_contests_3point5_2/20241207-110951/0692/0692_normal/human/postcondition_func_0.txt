The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the length of the list is between 1 and 150000, and each element falls between 1 and 10^6. The function iterates through the list to count the number of pairs where an element at a lower index is greater than an element at a higher index. However, the function does not return any specific value.
