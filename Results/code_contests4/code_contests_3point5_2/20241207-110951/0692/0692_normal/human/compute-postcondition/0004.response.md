Example Answer:
The value of `days` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not provide the current value of `days`, the output state is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. The element at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the element at index `j`, and `days` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. The element at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the element at index `j`, `days` is increased by 1**
