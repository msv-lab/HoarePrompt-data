Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `days` will be incremented by 1 for each pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time. And the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
