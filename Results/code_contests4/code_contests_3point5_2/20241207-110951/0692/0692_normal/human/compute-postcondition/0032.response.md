According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of the `arr` list is greater than 1. The loop will iterate over indices starting from 1 to the length of the list. The value of `j` will be used as an index in the loop. Since the loop is comparing pairs of elements at index `i` and `j`, the loop will run for all valid pairs.

To adjust the state before the loop starts:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
