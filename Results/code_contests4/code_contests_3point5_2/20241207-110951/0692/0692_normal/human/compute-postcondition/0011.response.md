According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and the length of the list `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and should be less than the length of `arr`.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time**
