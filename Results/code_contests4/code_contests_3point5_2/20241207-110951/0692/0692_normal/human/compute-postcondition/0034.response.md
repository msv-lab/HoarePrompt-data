Example Answer:
The value of `days` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `days` is 0, after execution, the value of `days` becomes 1. The other variables `arr` and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` is 1, `j` is 1. The element at index i in `arr` is greater than the element at index j in `arr`.**
