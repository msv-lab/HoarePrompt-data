Example Answer:
The value of `days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is unknown, so after execution, `days` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `days` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `days` is increased by 1**
