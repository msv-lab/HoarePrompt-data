According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and the length of the list `arr`. If `j` is less than the length of the list `arr`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` is 1, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` is 1, `j` is 2**
