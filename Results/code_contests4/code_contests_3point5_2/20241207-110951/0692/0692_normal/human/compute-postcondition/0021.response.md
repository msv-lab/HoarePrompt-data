Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `days` will be incremented by 1 for each pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time. If the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`, then `days` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
