According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of the arr list is at least 2 (len(arr) - 1). Since the loop iterates over the range of len(arr) - 1, the loop will execute if the length of arr is 2 or more. Before the loop starts, days is 0. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, arr should have a length of at least 2 and days should be 1.
State: **arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 150000 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6, days is 1 for the loop to execute**
