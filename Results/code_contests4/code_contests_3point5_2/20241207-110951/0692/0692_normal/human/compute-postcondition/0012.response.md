Example Answer:
`days` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `days` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `days` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `days` is incremented by 1**
