According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range of 1 to the length of the list `arr`. This means the loop will execute as long as there is more than 1 element in the list. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `arr` has at least 2 elements. Additionally, `j` needs to be set to 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
