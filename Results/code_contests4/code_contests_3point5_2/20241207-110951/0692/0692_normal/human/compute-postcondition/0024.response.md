Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` will be incremented by 1 for each pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time there must be at least 3 elements in the list that can be compared to increment `days` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
