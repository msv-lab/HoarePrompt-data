Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If the element at index `i` in `arr` is greater than the element at index `j`, `days` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no changes in the variables.***
