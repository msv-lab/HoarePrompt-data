According to the code, the loop executes for each index `j` in the range from 1 to the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one pair of elements in `arr` where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`. Additionally, if such a pair is found, the loop or if statement breaks out.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. For each pair of elements in `arr` where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `j`, `days` is incremented by 1. If such a pair is found, the loop or if statement breaks out.**
