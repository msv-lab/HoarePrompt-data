Example Answer:
`days` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `days` is 3. The values of `arr` and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` is 3, `j` is 3.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `days` is 3, `j` is 3**
