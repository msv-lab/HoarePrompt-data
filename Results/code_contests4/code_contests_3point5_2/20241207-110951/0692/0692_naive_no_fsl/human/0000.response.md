Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of days with a bad price as described in the problem. The program only increments the `days` variable when `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, which is not the correct condition to determine a bad price. 

A correct condition should be to check if there exists a lower price after the current day. A revised version of the program can be as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    days = 0
    min_price = arr[-1]
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] > min_price:
            days += 1
        else:
            min_price = arr[i]
    return days

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(arr)
    print(result)
```

In this corrected version, we keep track of the minimum price from the last day and iterate from the second last day to the first day, checking if the current price is higher than the minimum price. This correctly calculates the number of days with a bad price.
