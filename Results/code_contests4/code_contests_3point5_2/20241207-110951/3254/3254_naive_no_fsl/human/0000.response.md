Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect. It does not correctly calculate the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get in the sequence. The logic used in the program does not match the problem description. The program counts the number of inversions for each element in the sequence but does not account for the fact that Jeff can multiply some numbers by -1 to reduce the number of inversions. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
-2 1 -1
```
The correct output should be 3, but the program will output 1. This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle all cases as described in the problem.
