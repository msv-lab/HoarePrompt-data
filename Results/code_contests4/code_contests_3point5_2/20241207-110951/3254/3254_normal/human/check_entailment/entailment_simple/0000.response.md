Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of inversions that Jeff can get by multiplying some numbers by -1 in the given sequence. It follows the problem description by iterating through all pairs of elements in the sequence and counting the number of inversions that can be minimized by flipping the sign of some elements. The final count of inversions is printed as the output. The program handles all cases and provides the correct output.
