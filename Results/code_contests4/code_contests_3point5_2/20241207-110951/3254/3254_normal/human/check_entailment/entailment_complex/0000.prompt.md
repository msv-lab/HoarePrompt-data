You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p1, p2, ..., pn for his birthday.

Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a1, a2, ..., an is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality ai > aj holds.

Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p1, p2, ..., pn (|pi| ≤ 105). The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer. The input sequence contains n integers where |pi| is less than or equal to 105.**
def func():
    N, a, ans = input(), map(lambda x: abs(int(x)), raw_input().split()), 0
    for i in xrange(0, N):
        x, y = 0, 0
        
        for j in xrange(0, N):
            if a[j] < a[i]:
                if j < i:
                    x += 1
                else:
                    y += 1
        
        ans += min(x, y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is the total count of pairs (x, y) where x is the count of elements in `a` such that the value is less than the value at that index and the index is less than the current index i, and y is the count of elements in `a` such that the value is less than the value at that index and the index is greater than or equal to the current index i after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `N` followed by a sequence of integers. It then processes each integer in the sequence to count pairs (x, y) where x is the count of elements less than the value at that index and with an index less than the current index i, and y is the count of elements less than the value at that index and with an index greater than or equal to the current index i. The function calculates and prints the total count of such pairs `ans`. The function does not explicitly return a value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
