Correctness: **True**

The program reads an integer `n` followed by a sequence of integers and then calculates the minimum number of inversions that Jeff can get by multiplying some numbers by -1. It achieves this by counting pairs (x, y) where x is the count of elements less than the value at that index and with an index less than the current index i, and y is the count of elements less than the value at that index and with an index greater than or equal to the current index i. The program then prints the total count of such pairs `ans`, which is the minimum number of inversions Jeff can get. The program follows the problem description accurately and consistently for all potential cases.
