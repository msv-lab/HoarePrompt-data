Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the input value, `a` is assigned a map object that contains the absolute values of the integers inputted, and `ans` is initialized to 0. The map function applies the lambda function to each element of the input sequence. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0**
