Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`, `x` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j < i`, `y` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j >= i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is incremented by 1 if `a[j] < a[i]`, `y` remains the same, `j` is updated to j+1 for the loop to execute***
