Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`, `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. The element at index `j` in list `a` is less than the element at index `i` in list `a`.***
