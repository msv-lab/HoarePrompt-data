Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the minimum value between `x` and `y`. The previous values are `n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0, `x` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j < i`, `y` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j >= i`. After execution, `ans` will be updated based on the values of `x` and `y`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`, `x` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j < i`, `y` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j >= i`.**
