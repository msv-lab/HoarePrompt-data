Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is the total count of pairs (x, y) where x is the count of elements in `a` such that the value is less than the value at that index and the index is less than the current index i, and y is the count of elements in `a` such that the value is less than the value at that index and the index is greater than or equal to the current index i after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
