Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0, `x` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, `j` is 0. The absolute value at index `j` in list `a` is less than the absolute value at index `i` in list `a`. Additionally, `j` is less than `i`**
