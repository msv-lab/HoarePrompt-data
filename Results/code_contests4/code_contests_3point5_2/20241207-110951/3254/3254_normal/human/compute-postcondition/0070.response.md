Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` followed by a sequence of integers. It then processes each integer in the sequence to count pairs (x, y) where x is the count of elements less than the value at that index and with an index less than the current index i, and y is the count of elements less than the value at that index and with an index greater than or equal to the current index i. The function calculates and prints the total count of such pairs `ans`. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
