Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `N` is greater than 0, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0, `x` is either increased by 2 or remains 0, `y` is either 0, 1, or 2, `j` is N, the absolute value at index `j` in list `a` is less than or equal to the absolute value at index `i` in list `a`. After the execution of the if else block, the values of the variables will be updated based on the conditions met in the if part.***
