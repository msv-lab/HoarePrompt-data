Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `N` is greater than 0, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0, `x` is either increased by 3 or remains 0, `y` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `j` is N-1, the absolute value at index `j` in list `a` is less than or equal to the absolute value at index `i` in list `a`. If `a[j] < a[i]` and `j` < `i`, `x` is increased by 3 and `y` is set to 1, 2, or 3 based on the previous value of `y`. If `a[j] < a[i]` but `j` >= `i`, `x` remains the same and `y` is set to 0, 1, or 2 based on the previous value of `y`.***
