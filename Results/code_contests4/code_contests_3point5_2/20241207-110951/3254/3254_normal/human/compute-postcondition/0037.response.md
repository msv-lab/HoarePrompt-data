Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`, `x` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j < i`, `y` is the total count of times `a[j] < a[i]` and `j >= i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is incremented by 1 if `a[j] < a[i]`, `y` is incremented by 1 if `a[j] < a[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `N`. After the if else block executes, `x` is incremented by 1 if `j < i` and `y` is incremented by 1 if `j >= i`.***
