Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0, `x` is either increased by 1 or remains 0, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0, `y` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0. The absolute value at index `j` in list `a` is less than or equal to the absolute value at index `i` in list `a`. Additionally, either `j` is less than `i` or `j` is equal to `i` after the execution of the if else block.***
