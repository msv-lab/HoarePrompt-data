Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are either 1 or 0 based on the condition of the if-else block, `j` is 1. If `j` is less than `i`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` is increased by 1***
