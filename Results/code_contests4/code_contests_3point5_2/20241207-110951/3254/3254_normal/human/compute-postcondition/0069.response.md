The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is implied that the function works with a sequence of integers. The constraints specify that the sequence contains n integers, where n is a positive integer, and each integer in the sequence is less than or equal to 105. The function processes these integers in the sequence.

The function `func` does not explicitly specify a return value in the given information. Therefore, the return value of the function is not defined in this context.
