According to the code, the loop will execute N times starting from 0. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `N` is the input value, `a` contains the absolute values of the input integers, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than 0**
