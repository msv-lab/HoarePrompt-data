Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of inversions that Jeff can get by multiplying some numbers of the sequence by -1. The program seems to calculate the number of inversions in the original sequence, rather than considering the impact of multiplying some numbers by -1.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
-1 1 -2
```
The correct output should be 2, as Jeff can multiply the numbers by -1 to get the sequence -1, -1, 2 which has 2 inversions. However, the program will output 4 as it calculates the number of inversions in the original sequence.
