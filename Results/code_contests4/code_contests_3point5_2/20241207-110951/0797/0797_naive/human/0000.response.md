Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement. It calculates the absolute differences of N and K and returns the minimum possible value taken by N after the operation is performed zero or more times. The logic of finding the minimum between N % K and K - N % K is correct and covers all potential cases. The program works as expected for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
