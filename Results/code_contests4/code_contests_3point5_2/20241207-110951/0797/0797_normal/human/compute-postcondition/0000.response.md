Example Answer:
N and K are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers. The values of N and K can be any non-negative integers within the given range. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ $10^{18}$ and 1 ≤ K ≤ $10^{18}$.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ $10^{18}$ and 1 ≤ K ≤ $10^{18}$**
