The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the result of the expression $N^K + K$. The constraints for the parameters N and K are that they are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ N ≤ $10^{18}$ and 1 ≤ K ≤ $10^{18}$. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the result of the expression $N^K + K$ given the constraints on N and K.
