Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two non-negative integers N and K as input, where 0 ≤ N ≤ $10^{18}$ and 1 ≤ K ≤ $10^{18}$.
- It then calculates and prints the minimum value between N % K and K - N % K, which aligns with the problem description of finding the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times.
- The code seems to handle all potential cases correctly based on the problem description and the provided examples.
