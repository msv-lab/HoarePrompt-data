Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the operation described in the problem description. It takes the input values for N and K, then calculates the absolute difference between N and K using the min function. This ensures that the minimum possible value taken by N after Aoki does the operation zero or more times is correctly calculated. The program works for all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately.
