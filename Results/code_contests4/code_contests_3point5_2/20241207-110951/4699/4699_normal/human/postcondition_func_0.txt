The function `func_1` accepts a list `A` of integers and two integers `m` and `k` that satisfy certain constraints. The function calculates the length of list `A` and performs different operations based on specific conditions. 

- Case 1: If the length of list `A` is 1, the function returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of variables `m` and `k`.
- Case 2: If the length of list `A` is even, the function returns 0.
- Case 3: If the calculated moves exceed the integer `m`, the function returns 0.
- Case 4: The function returns the minimum value at even indices in list A or the result of dividing `m` by moves and multiplying the result by `k`.

The functionality covers the cases specified in the annotations. If there are additional edge cases or missing functionality, the function may not behave as expected.
