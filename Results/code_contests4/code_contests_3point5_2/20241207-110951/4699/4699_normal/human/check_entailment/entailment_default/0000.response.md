Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` in the code does not cover all possible scenarios outlined in the problem description. The cases specified in the output hints do not match with the logic implemented in the function. Additionally, the code has some mistakes such as using `/` instead of `//` for integer division, which can lead to incorrect results. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the discrepancies between the problem description, output hints, and the actual implementation.
