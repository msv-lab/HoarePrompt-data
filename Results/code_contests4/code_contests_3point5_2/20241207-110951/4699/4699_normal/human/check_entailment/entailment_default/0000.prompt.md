You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It is nighttime and Joe the Elusive got into the country's main bank's safe. The safe has n cells positioned in a row, each of them contains some amount of diamonds. Let's make the problem more comfortable to work with and mark the cells with positive numbers from 1 to n from the left to the right.

Unfortunately, Joe didn't switch the last security system off. On the plus side, he knows the way it works.

Every minute the security system calculates the total amount of diamonds for each two adjacent cells (for the cells between whose numbers difference equals 1). As a result of this check we get an n - 1 sums. If at least one of the sums differs from the corresponding sum received during the previous check, then the security system is triggered.

Joe can move the diamonds from one cell to another between the security system's checks. He manages to move them no more than m times between two checks. One of the three following operations is regarded as moving a diamond: moving a diamond from any cell to any other one, moving a diamond from any cell to Joe's pocket, moving a diamond from Joe's pocket to any cell. Initially Joe's pocket is empty, and it can carry an unlimited amount of diamonds. It is considered that before all Joe's actions the system performs at least one check.

In the morning the bank employees will come, which is why Joe has to leave the bank before that moment. Joe has only k minutes left before morning, and on each of these k minutes he can perform no more than m operations. All that remains in Joe's pocket, is considered his loot.

Calculate the largest amount of diamonds Joe can carry with him. Don't forget that the security system shouldn't be triggered (even after Joe leaves the bank) and Joe should leave before morning.

Input

The first line contains integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 104, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 109). The next line contains n numbers. The i-th number is equal to the amount of diamonds in the i-th cell — it is an integer from 0 to 105.

Output

Print a single number — the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal.

Examples

Input

2 3 1
2 3


Output

0

Input

3 2 2
4 1 3


Output

2

Note

In the second sample Joe can act like this:

The diamonds' initial positions are 4 1 3.

During the first period of time Joe moves a diamond from the 1-th cell to the 2-th one and a diamond from the 3-th cell to his pocket.

By the end of the first period the diamonds' positions are 3 2 2. The check finds no difference and the security system doesn't go off.

During the second period Joe moves a diamond from the 3-rd cell to the 2-nd one and puts a diamond from the 1-st cell to his pocket.

By the end of the second period the diamonds' positions are 2 3 1. The check finds no difference again and the security system doesn't go off.

Now Joe leaves with 2 diamonds in his pocket.
Program:
```
import sys
input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
S = input.readline().split(' ')
n = int(S[0])
m = int(S[1])
k = int(S[2])
assert 1 <= n and n <= 10 ** 4
assert 1 <= m and m <= 10 ** 9
assert 1 <= k and k <= 10 ** 9
A = [int(s) for s in input.readline().split(' ')]
assert len(A) == n
MAX_A = 10 ** 5
assert all(map(lambda a: 0 <= a and a <= MAX_A, A))
answer = func_1(A, m, k)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)
input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout

def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if n == 1:
        return min(A[0], m * k)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 0
    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if moves > m:
        return 0
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
S = input.readline().split(' ')
n = int(S[0])
m = int(S[1])
k = int(S[2])
assert 1 <= n and n <= 10 ** 4
assert 1 <= m and m <= 10 ** 9
assert 1 <= k and k <= 10 ** 9
A = [int(s) for s in input.readline().split(' ')]
assert len(A) == n
MAX_A = 10 ** 5
assert all(map(lambda a: 0 <= a and a <= MAX_A, A))
answer = func_1(A, m, k)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)
```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `A` of integers and two integers `m` and `k` that satisfy certain constraints. The function calculates the length of list `A` and performs different operations based on specific conditions. 

- Case 1: If the length of list `A` is 1, the function returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of variables `m` and `k`.
- Case 2: If the length of list `A` is even, the function returns 0.
- Case 3: If the calculated moves exceed the integer `m`, the function returns 0.
- Case 4: The function returns the minimum value at even indices in list A or the result of dividing `m` by moves and multiplying the result by `k`.

The functionality covers the cases specified in the annotations. If there are additional edge cases or missing functionality, the function may not behave as expected.

First I want you to try to see if the code does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code must exactly follow the problem description for all cases to be correct.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
