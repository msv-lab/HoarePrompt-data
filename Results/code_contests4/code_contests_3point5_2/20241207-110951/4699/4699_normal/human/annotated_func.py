#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^9. A is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^5.**
def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if (n == 1) :
        return min(A[0], m * k)
        #The program returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of variables m and k
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the length of list `A`, and `n` is not equal to 1.
    if (n % 2 == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the length of list `A`, and `n` is not equal to 1. The length of list `A` is an odd number, and `n` is larger than 1.
    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if (moves > m) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is the length of list A, n is not equal to 1 and is an odd number, moves is calculated as n / 2 + 1. Additionally, moves is less than or equal to m
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
    #The program returns the minimum value 'M' at even indices in list A or m divided by moves multiplied by k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `A` of integers and two integers `m` and `k` that satisfy certain constraints. The function calculates the length of list `A` and performs different operations based on specific conditions. 

- Case 1: If the length of list `A` is 1, the function returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of variables `m` and `k`.
- Case 2: If the length of list `A` is even, the function returns 0.
- Case 3: If the calculated moves exceed the integer `m`, the function returns 0.
- Case 4: The function returns the minimum value at even indices in list A or the result of dividing `m` by moves and multiplying the result by `k`.

The functionality covers the cases specified in the annotations. If there are additional edge cases or missing functionality, the function may not behave as expected.
