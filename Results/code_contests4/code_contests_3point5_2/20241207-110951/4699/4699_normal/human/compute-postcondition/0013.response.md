The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list `A` of integers, and two integers `m` and `k`. The integers `n`, `m`, and `k` satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^9. The list `A` contains `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^5. 

After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case 1: The program returns the minimum value between the first element of list A and the product of variables `m` and `k`.
- Case 2: The program returns 0.
- Case 3: The program returns 0.
- Case 4: The program returns the minimum value 'M' at even indices in list A or `m` divided by moves multiplied by `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `A` of integers, and two integers `m` and `k` that satisfy the given constraints. The function then returns different values based on the specified cases mentioned above.
