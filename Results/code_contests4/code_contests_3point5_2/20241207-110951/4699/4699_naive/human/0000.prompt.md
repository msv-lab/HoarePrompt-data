You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It is nighttime and Joe the Elusive got into the country's main bank's safe. The safe has n cells positioned in a row, each of them contains some amount of diamonds. Let's make the problem more comfortable to work with and mark the cells with positive numbers from 1 to n from the left to the right.

Unfortunately, Joe didn't switch the last security system off. On the plus side, he knows the way it works.

Every minute the security system calculates the total amount of diamonds for each two adjacent cells (for the cells between whose numbers difference equals 1). As a result of this check we get an n - 1 sums. If at least one of the sums differs from the corresponding sum received during the previous check, then the security system is triggered.

Joe can move the diamonds from one cell to another between the security system's checks. He manages to move them no more than m times between two checks. One of the three following operations is regarded as moving a diamond: moving a diamond from any cell to any other one, moving a diamond from any cell to Joe's pocket, moving a diamond from Joe's pocket to any cell. Initially Joe's pocket is empty, and it can carry an unlimited amount of diamonds. It is considered that before all Joe's actions the system performs at least one check.

In the morning the bank employees will come, which is why Joe has to leave the bank before that moment. Joe has only k minutes left before morning, and on each of these k minutes he can perform no more than m operations. All that remains in Joe's pocket, is considered his loot.

Calculate the largest amount of diamonds Joe can carry with him. Don't forget that the security system shouldn't be triggered (even after Joe leaves the bank) and Joe should leave before morning.

Input

The first line contains integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 104, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 109). The next line contains n numbers. The i-th number is equal to the amount of diamonds in the i-th cell — it is an integer from 0 to 105.

Output

Print a single number — the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal.

Examples

Input

2 3 1
2 3


Output

0

Input

3 2 2
4 1 3


Output

2

Note

In the second sample Joe can act like this:

The diamonds' initial positions are 4 1 3.

During the first period of time Joe moves a diamond from the 1-th cell to the 2-th one and a diamond from the 3-th cell to his pocket.

By the end of the first period the diamonds' positions are 3 2 2. The check finds no difference and the security system doesn't go off.

During the second period Joe moves a diamond from the 3-rd cell to the 2-nd one and puts a diamond from the 1-st cell to his pocket.

By the end of the second period the diamonds' positions are 2 3 1. The check finds no difference again and the security system doesn't go off.

Now Joe leaves with 2 diamonds in his pocket.
Program:
```
input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout

def func_1(A, m, k):
    n = len(A)
    if n == 1:
        return min(A[0], m * k)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 0
    moves = n / 2 + 1
    if moves > m:
        return 0
    M = min(A[0:n:2])
    return min(M, m / moves * k)
S = input.readline().split(' ')
n = int(S[0])
m = int(S[1])
k = int(S[2])
assert 1 <= n and n <= 10 ** 4
assert 1 <= m and m <= 10 ** 9
assert 1 <= k and k <= 10 ** 9
A = [int(s) for s in input.readline().split(' ')]
assert len(A) == n
MAX_A = 10 ** 5
assert all(map(lambda a: 0 <= a and a <= MAX_A, A))
answer = func_1(A, m, k)
output.write('%s\n' % answer)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
