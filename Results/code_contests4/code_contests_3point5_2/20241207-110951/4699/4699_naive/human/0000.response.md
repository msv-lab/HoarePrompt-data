Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` provided in the program does not accurately calculate the maximum number of diamonds Joe can steal while ensuring the security system is not triggered. The logic used in the function is incorrect and does not follow the problem description.

One example where the program fails to produce the correct output is as follows:

Input:
3 2 2
4 1 3

Expected Output:
2

Explanation:
In this scenario, Joe can perform the following actions:
1. Move a diamond from the 1st cell to the 2nd cell and a diamond from the 3rd cell to his pocket.
2. Move a diamond from the 3rd cell to the 2nd cell and put a diamond from the 1st cell to his pocket.

By the end of the second period, Joe can leave with 2 diamonds in his pocket without triggering the security system. However, the given program does not produce the correct output for this case.
