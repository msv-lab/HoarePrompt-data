Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input matrix representing the buttons pressed on the terminal. It then checks if the password is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal by comparing the corresponding buttons on opposite sides of the central button. The conditions in the if statement correctly check for symmetry based on the description provided. If any of the conditions fail, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the password is symmetric or not.
