Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input matrix and checks if it is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. It covers all possible symmetric cases and outputs 'YES' if the password is symmetric, and 'NO' otherwise. The logic seems to be correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
