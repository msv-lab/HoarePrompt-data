Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a 3x3 grid of symbols where 'X' represents a button pressed and '.' represents a button not pressed. It then checks specific conditions to determine if the password is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. The code correctly checks if the password is symmetric based on the description provided. The conditions in the code align with the concept of central symmetry, where the password should be symmetric about the central button. The code correctly prints 'YES' if the password is symmetric and 'NO' otherwise. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code is implementing the logic described in the problem statement.
