Correctness: **True**

The program reads a 3x3 grid of 'X' and '.' symbols as input. It then checks if the password entered is symmetric with respect to the central button of the terminal. The conditions specified in the if statement correctly check for central symmetry based on the positions of 'X' in the input matrix. If any of the conditions for non-symmetry are met, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This aligns with the problem description and correctly determines if the password is symmetric or not.
