Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads a 3x3 grid of 'X' and '.' symbols as input, checks specific conditions within the grid to determine if it is symmetric with respect to the central button, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The conditions checked by the program are in line with the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
