According to the code, the loop can execute regardless of the initial state of the input matrix. The loop variable `i` will iterate from 0 to 2 inclusive, ensuring that the loop runs three times. Since `lines` is initially an empty list, it needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop has executed at least once.
State: **The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols; `lines` is a non-empty list after the loop has executed at least once**
