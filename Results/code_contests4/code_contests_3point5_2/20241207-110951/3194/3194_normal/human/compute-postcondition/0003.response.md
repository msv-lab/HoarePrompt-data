According to the code, the loop will execute 3 times, once for each row in the 3x3 input matrix. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed all 3 rows of the matrix. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the input matrix must contain more rows to process.
State: **The input matrix is a 4x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols; `lines` is a list containing multiple lines of input**
