Example Answer:
A new line is read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and is appended to the `lines` list. The input matrix is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The input matrix is a 4x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols; `lines` contains multiple lines of input.
Output State: **The input matrix is a 4x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols; `lines` contains multiple lines of input**
