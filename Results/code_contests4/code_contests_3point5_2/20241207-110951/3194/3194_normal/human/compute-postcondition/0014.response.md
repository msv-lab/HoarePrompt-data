Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user as a 3x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols. It then checks specific conditions within the grid and prints 'NO' if any of those conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
