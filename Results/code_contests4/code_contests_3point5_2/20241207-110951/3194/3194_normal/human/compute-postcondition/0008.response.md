Postcondition: ***The input matrix is a 4x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols; `lines` contains multiple lines of input. If the condition `(lines[0][0] == 'X' and lines[2][2] != 'X') or (lines[0][1] == 'X' and lines[2][1] != 'X') or (lines[0][2] == 'X' and lines[2][0] != 'X') or (lines[1][0] == 'X' and lines[1][2] != 'X') or (lines[1][2] == 'X' and lines[1][0] != 'X')` is true, then the program state will be as described.***
