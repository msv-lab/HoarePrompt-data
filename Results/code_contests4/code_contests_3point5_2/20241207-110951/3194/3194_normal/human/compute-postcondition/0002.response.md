Example Answer:
`lines` is appended with the value of `sys.stdin.readline()`. As `lines` is non-empty after the loop has executed at least once, it implies that `lines` already contains some values. Therefore, the Output State is: The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols; `lines` is a list containing multiple lines of input.
Output State: **The input matrix is a 3x3 grid containing either 'X' or '.' symbols; `lines` is a list containing multiple lines of input**
