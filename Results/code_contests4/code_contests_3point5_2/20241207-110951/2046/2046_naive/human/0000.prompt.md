You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are playing the game "Arranging The Sheep". The goal of this game is to make the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one square to the right, if the corresponding square exists and is empty. The game ends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty cells between any sheep.

For example, if n=6 and the level is described by the string "**.*..", then the following game scenario is possible: 

  * the sheep at the 4 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "**..*."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "*.*.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 1 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".**.*."; 
  * the sheep at the 3 position moves to the right, the state of the level: ".*.**."; 
  * the sheep at the 2 position moves to the right, the state of the level: "..***."; 
  * the sheep are lined up and the game ends. 



For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

The second line of each test case contains a string of length n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep) — the description of the level.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case output the minimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level.

Example

Input


5
6
**.*..
5
*****
3
.*.
3
...
10
*.*...*.**


Output

0
0
9
Program:
```
le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
af = []
for zorg in range(int(le.pop())):
    n = int(le.pop())
    l = le.pop()
    l = [k for k in range(n) if l[k] == '*']
    l = [b - a for (a, b) in enumerate(l)]
    if l:
        med = l[len(l) // 2]
        af.append(sum((abs(k - med) for k in l)))
    else:
        af.append(0)
print('\n'.join(map(str, af)))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
