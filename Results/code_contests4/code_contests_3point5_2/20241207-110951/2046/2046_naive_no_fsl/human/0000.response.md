Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not implement the game logic of moving the sheep to the left or right to line them up. Instead, it seems to be calculating the minimum number of moves needed to line up the sheep based on their current positions, which is incorrect. 

For example, for the input:
```
3
3
.*.
3
...
10
*.*...*.**
```
The expected output should be:
```
0
0
9
```
However, the program will not produce the correct output for these cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
