Example Answer:
`l` is assigned a list comprehension that iterates over the range of `n` and filters elements from `l` that are equal to '*'. However, since `le` is an empty list, attempting to access elements from it will result in an IndexError. Therefore, the program terminates with an IndexError as `le` is an empty list.
Output State: **The program terminates with an IndexError as `le` is an empty list**
