According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list `le`. However, since `l` is an empty list and the program terminates with an IndexError, there are no changes to `l` after the if-else block. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the list `le` must not be empty.

State: **The program terminates with an IndexError as `l` is an empty list. No changes occur to the state of `l`.**
