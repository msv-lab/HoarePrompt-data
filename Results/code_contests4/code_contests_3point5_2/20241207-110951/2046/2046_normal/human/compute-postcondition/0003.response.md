Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the integer popped from the list `le`. Since `le` is required to have at least 1 valid integer value popped for the loop to execute the first time, we can assume that `le` contains at least one valid integer value. Therefore, `n` will be assigned that integer value. The value of `zorg` remains 0. 
Output State: **`af` is an empty list, `le` is an empty list, `zorg` is 0, `n` is the integer value popped from `le`**
