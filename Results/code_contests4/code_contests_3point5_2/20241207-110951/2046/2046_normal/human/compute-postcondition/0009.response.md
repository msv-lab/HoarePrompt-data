Example Answer:
The code attempts to calculate the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the empty list `l` and the variable `med`. However, since `l` is empty and there are no elements to iterate over, an IndexError is raised and the program terminates. Therefore, the Output State is: The program terminates with an IndexError as `l` is an empty list.
Output State: **The program terminates with an IndexError as `l` is an empty list.**
