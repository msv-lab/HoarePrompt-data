According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value popped from the list `le`. If the popped value is a valid integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `af` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `le` has at least 1 valid integer value popped. Additionally, for the loop to execute the first time, `zorg` needs to be 0.
State: **`af` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `le` has at least 1 valid integer value popped, `zorg` is 0**
