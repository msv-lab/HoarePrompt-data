Example Answer: 
The list comprehension is trying to subtract each element `a` from its corresponding index `b` in the list `l`. However, as `l` is empty, it will raise an IndexError when trying to iterate over an empty list. Therefore, the program terminates with an IndexError as `l` is an empty list.
Output State: **The program terminates with an IndexError as `l` is an empty list**
