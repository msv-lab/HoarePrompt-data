Example Answer:
The code snippet prints each element of the list `af` separated by a newline character. If the loop executes, `af` contains [0] and the output will be 0 printed on a new line. If the loop does not execute, `af` remains an empty list, and nothing will be printed. Therefore, the Output State is: If the loop executes, 0 is printed on a new line. If the loop does not execute, nothing is printed.
Output State: **If the loop executes, 0 is printed on a new line. If the loop does not execute, nothing is printed.**
