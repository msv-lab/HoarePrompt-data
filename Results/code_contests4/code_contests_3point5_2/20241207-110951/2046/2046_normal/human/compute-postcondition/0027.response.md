Example Answer:

The code snippet tries to access the middle element of the list `l` by using `len(l) // 2`. However, since `l` is an empty list, accessing the middle element will result in an IndexError. Therefore, the code snippet will throw an error and not execute successfully.

Output State: **IndexError: list index out of range**
