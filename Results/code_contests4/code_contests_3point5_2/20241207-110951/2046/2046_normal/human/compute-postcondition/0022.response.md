According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `le`. If `le` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the program terminates with an IndexError as `l` is an empty list. No changes occur to the state of `l` after the execution of the if else block. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `le` must not be empty.
State: **The program terminates with an IndexError as `l` is an empty list, no changes occur to the state of `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `le` must not be empty**
