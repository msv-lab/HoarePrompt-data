Example Answer:
`af` is appended with the sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in list `l` and the median value `med`. The list `l` caused an IndexError: list index out of range, so it is assumed to be empty. Therefore, the sum of absolute differences is 0, and `af` will contain [0]. 
Output State: **IndexError: list index out of range, `af` contains [0]**
