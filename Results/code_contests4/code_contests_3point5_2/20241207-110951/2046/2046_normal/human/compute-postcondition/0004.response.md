Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the value popped from `le`, and since `le` is an empty list, an IndexError will be raised. Therefore, the program will terminate with an error. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **The program terminates with an IndexError as `le` is an empty list**
