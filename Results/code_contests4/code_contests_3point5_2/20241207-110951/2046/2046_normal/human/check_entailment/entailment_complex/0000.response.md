Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input for each test case, calculates the distance between consecutive '*' characters, finds the median distance, and then computes the sum of absolute differences between each distance and the median. Finally, it prints the resulting sums for each test case.

The program iterates through all test cases and correctly calculates the minimum number of moves needed to complete the level for each case. The logic used to calculate the distances and find the median is in line with the requirements of the game "Arranging The Sheep". The output of the program matches the expected output based on the provided problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for each test case.
