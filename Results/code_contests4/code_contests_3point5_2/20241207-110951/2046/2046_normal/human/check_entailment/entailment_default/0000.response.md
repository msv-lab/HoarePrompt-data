Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description. The issue lies in the way the distances between consecutive '*' characters are calculated. The code calculates the distance based on the index positions of the '*' characters instead of counting the number of empty spaces between them. This can lead to incorrect results as it does not accurately represent the minimum number of moves needed to line up the sheep. 

For example, given the input:
```
5
6
**.*..
```
The code will calculate the distances between the '*' characters as [0, 1], which leads to a sum of absolute differences equal to 1. However, the correct answer should be 1 move to line up the sheep. 

Therefore, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, making the correctness **False**.
