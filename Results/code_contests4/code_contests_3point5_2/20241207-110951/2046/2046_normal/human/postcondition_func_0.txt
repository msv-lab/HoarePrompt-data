The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes each test case consisting of an integer `n` and a string of length `n` containing '*' and '.', calculates the distance between consecutive '*' characters, finds the median distance, and computes the sum of absolute differences between each distance and the median. The function then prints the resulting sums for each test case. The function does not explicitly return a value.
