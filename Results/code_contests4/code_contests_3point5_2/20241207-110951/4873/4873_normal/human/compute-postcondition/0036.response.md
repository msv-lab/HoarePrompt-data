Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and 3 strings into a list `a`. It then iterates `n` times, creating a dictionary `bucket` with keys as characters at the respective positions in the strings. The function calculates the total number of unique characters at each position in the strings and subtracts 3. Finally, it prints the resulting value `foo`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
