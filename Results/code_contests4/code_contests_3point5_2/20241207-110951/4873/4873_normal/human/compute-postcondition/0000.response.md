Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`. The function `raw_input()` reads a line from input and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespaces. Therefore, the value of `n` will be based on the input provided. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer value based on the input provided**
