You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given three strings A, B and C. Each of these is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Our objective is to make all these three strings equal. For that, you can repeatedly perform the following operation:

* Operation: Choose one of the strings A, B and C, and specify an integer i between 1 and N (inclusive). Change the i-th character from the beginning of the chosen string to some other lowercase English letter.



What is the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* Each of the strings A, B and C is a string of length N.
* Each character in each of the strings A, B and C is a lowercase English letter.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A
B
C


Output

Print the minimum number of operations required.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    a = [raw_input().strip() for i in xrange(3)]
    foo = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        bucket = {}
        
        for s in a:
            bucket[s[i]] = True
        
        foo += len(bucket) - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer value greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list containing 3 or more strings, `foo` is the total number of unique characters at the respective positions in the strings minus 3, `i` is n, `bucket` is a dictionary with keys as characters at index n-1 of each string in `a` set to True
    print(foo)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and 3 strings into a list `a`. It then iterates `n` times, creating a dictionary `bucket` with keys as characters at the respective positions in the strings. The function calculates the total number of unique characters at each position in the strings and subtracts 3. Finally, it prints the resulting value `foo`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
