Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal. The function reads an integer `n` and 3 strings into a list `a`, then iterates `n` times to create a dictionary `bucket` with keys as characters at the respective positions in the strings. It calculates the total number of unique characters at each position in the strings and subtracts 3, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make all three strings equal.

The code aligns with the problem description and the output hints confirm that the function is correctly implemented for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
