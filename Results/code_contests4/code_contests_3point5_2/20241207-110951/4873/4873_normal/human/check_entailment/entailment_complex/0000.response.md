Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input strings and iterates over each position in the strings, counting the number of unique characters at that position. The program then subtracts 3 from the total count of unique characters to get the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal. The final output is the correct minimum number of operations required based on the problem description.
