Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all three strings equal by iterating through each position in the strings and keeping track of the unique characters at that position. The program correctly follows the problem description by calculating the total number of unique characters at each position in the strings and subtracting 3 to get the minimum number of operations required.

The program works for all potential cases as it iterates through each position in the strings, considers all three strings, and keeps track of the unique characters at that position. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and outputs the correct minimum number of operations required.
