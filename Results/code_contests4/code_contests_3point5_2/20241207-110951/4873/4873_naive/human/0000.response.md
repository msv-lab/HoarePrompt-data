Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly reads the input N and three strings A, B, and C. It then iterates over the strings character by character and keeps track of the distinct characters at each position using a dictionary. Since the objective is to make all strings equal, the minimum number of operations required is to change each character to the most common character at that position. The program correctly computes this by counting the distinct characters at each position and subtracting 1. Therefore, the program satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
