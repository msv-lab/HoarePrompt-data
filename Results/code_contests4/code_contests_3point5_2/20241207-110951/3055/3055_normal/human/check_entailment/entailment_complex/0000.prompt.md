You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: President of Berland has a very vast office-room, where, apart from him, work his subordinates. Each subordinate, as well as President himself, has his own desk of a unique colour. Each desk is rectangular, and its sides are parallel to the office walls. One day President decided to establish an assembly, of which all his deputies will be members. Unfortunately, he does not remember the exact amount of his deputies, but he remembers that the desk of each his deputy is adjacent to his own desk, that is to say, the two desks (President's and each deputy's) have a common side of a positive length.

The office-room plan can be viewed as a matrix with n rows and m columns. Each cell of this matrix is either empty, or contains a part of a desk. An uppercase Latin letter stands for each desk colour. The «period» character («.») stands for an empty cell. 

Input

The first line contains two separated by a space integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the length and the width of the office-room, and c character — the President's desk colour. The following n lines contain m characters each — the office-room description. It is guaranteed that the colour of each desk is unique, and each desk represents a continuous subrectangle of the given matrix. All colours are marked by uppercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the only number — the amount of President's deputies.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, c is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour. The office-room description is a matrix of n rows and m columns with unique uppercase Latin letters representing desk colours and periods representing empty cells.**
def func():
    i1 = False or 0
    ii = False or 1
    iii = False or 2
    k = raw_input().split(' ')
    n, m, c = int(k[i1]), int(k[ii]), k[iii]
    mtrx = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    frnds = set([])
    k = int(False)
    while k < n:
        col = raw_input()
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < m:
            mtrx[k].extend(col[j])
            j = j + 1
        
        k = k + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the raw input value, `j` is equal to the final value of `m`, `k` is equal to the final value of `n` where `k` is incremented by 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if mtrx[i][j] == c and mtrx[i][j] != '.':
                if i - 1 > 0:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i - 1][j])
                if j - 1 > 0:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i][j - 1])
                if j + 1 < m:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i][j + 1])
                if i + 1 < n:
                    frnds.add(mtrx[i + 1][j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with updated values based on the conditions met in the loop. The set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. `j` is equal to `m` and `k` is equal to `n+1`
    if ('.' in frnds) :
        frnds.remove('.')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with updated values based on the conditions met in the loop. The set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. `j` is equal to `m` and `k` is equal to `n+1`. There is at least one element '.' in the set `frnds` except for '.' that has been removed.
    print(len(frnds))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func reads input to describe an office-room matrix, identifies adjacent elements to the President's desk color, and prints the count of those adjacent elements. If a '.' is found in the adjacent elements, it is removed before counting. The function does not accept any parameters and provides information about the office-room matrix based on the constraints provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
