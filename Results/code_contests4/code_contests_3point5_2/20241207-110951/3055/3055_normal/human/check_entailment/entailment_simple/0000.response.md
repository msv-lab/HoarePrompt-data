Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of President's deputies. The issue lies in the condition checks for `i-1 > 0` and `j-1 > 0`, which should be `i-1 >= 0` and `j-1 >= 0` respectively, as the indices start from 0. This causes the program to miss counting deputies when they are on the first row or first column of the matrix.

Additionally, the check for `'.' in frnds` followed by removing `'.'` from `frnds` is incorrect as it will remove any desk color that contains `'.'` as a neighbor, which is not the intended behavior according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for and is incorrect.
