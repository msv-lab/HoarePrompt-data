According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to the final value of `n`, which means it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the raw input value, `j` is equal to the final value of `m`, `k` is equal to the final value of `n` where `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again**
