Example Answer:
`frnds` is a set that adds the value at index `[i - 1][j]` from the matrix `mtrx`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `c` are positive integers, and `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value. The loop will execute one more time based on the specified rules. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set with added value at index `[i - 1][j]`**
