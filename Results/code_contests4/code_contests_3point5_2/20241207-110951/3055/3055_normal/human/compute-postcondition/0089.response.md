According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. Before the loop starts, it also depends on `n`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, and `frnds`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- `n`, `m`, and `c` are already positive integers so they do not need to be adjusted.
- `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, so it should be maintained.
- The set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.', so it should be maintained.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n+1`, but `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. It seems like there might be a typo here, and it should be `j` instead of `i`. So, adjust `j` to be 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, the set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.', `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` must be less than `m`**
