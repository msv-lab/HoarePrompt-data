Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `c` are assigned the values extracted from the split `k` list at indexes `i1`, `ii`, and `iii` respectively. The values of `i1`, `ii`, and `iii` are either False or 1, 2. So, after execution, `n` and `m` will be positive integers, and `c` will be a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour**
