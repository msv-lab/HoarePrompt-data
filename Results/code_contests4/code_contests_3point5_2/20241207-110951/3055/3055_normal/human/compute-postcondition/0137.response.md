Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j` are integers incremented by 1, `j` is -1, `frnds` set contains the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]` and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. The loop executes the first time `m` is greater than 0, the element in the matrix at row `i` and column `j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', `(i + 1 < n)`***
