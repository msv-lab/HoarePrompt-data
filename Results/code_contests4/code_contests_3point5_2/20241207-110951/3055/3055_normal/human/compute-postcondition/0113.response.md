Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j+1`, `frnds` have been updated based on the conditions met in the loop body for the next iteration. If `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', then the following actions take place: if `i - 1 > 0`, the element at position (i - 1, j) in `mtrx` is added to `frnds`. Similarly, if `j - 1 > 0`, the element at position (i, j - 1) in `mtrx` is added to `frnds`. If `j + 1 < m`, the element at position (i, j + 1) in `mtrx` is added to `frnds`. Additionally, if `i + 1 < n`, the element at position (i + 1, j) in `mtrx` is added to `frnds`.***
