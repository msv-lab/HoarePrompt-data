According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 2 so that it becomes greater than 0 but less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the raw input value, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to the final value of `n` where `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again**
