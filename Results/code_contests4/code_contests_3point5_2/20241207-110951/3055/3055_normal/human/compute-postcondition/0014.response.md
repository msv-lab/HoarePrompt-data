According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the value entered as raw input at index `j`, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `col` is assigned the value entered as raw input, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `m`**
