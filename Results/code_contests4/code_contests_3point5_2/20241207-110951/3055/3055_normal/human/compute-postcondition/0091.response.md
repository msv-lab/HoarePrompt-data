Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers. `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value. `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. `j` is 0 and will be incremented by 1 after each iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute the first time `j` must be less than `m`. When the if condition is met, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. Additionally, `i` is greater than 1***
