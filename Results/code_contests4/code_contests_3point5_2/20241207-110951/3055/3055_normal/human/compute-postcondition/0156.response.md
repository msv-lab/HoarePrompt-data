Example Answer:
The value `mtrx[i][j + 1]` is added to the set `frnds`. The variable `frnds` is updated with the new value. The other variables remain the same as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `c`, `i` are all integers incremented by 1. `j` is 0. `frnds` set contains the updated values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i` are all integers incremented by 1. `j` is 0. `frnds` set contains the updated values**
