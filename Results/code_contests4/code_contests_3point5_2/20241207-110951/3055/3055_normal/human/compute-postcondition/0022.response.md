According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be less than the new value of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the value entered as raw input at all indices, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `col` is assigned the value entered as raw input, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than the new value of `n`**
