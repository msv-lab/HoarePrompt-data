According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, so `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows extended by user input at index `j`, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the value entered as raw input, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than `m` and `j` is incremented by 1**
