According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `c`, `i` are all incremented by 1. `j` is -1. `frnds` set contains the values of `mtrx[i - 1][j - 1]`, `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, `mtrx[i][j + 1]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So, for the next iteration, the updated state should be:
State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i` are incremented by 1. `j` is 0. `frnds` set contains the values of `mtrx[i - 1][0]`, `mtrx[i - 1][1]`, `mtrx[i][0]`, `mtrx[i][1]`, and `mtrx[i + 1][0]`. If `i - 1 > 0`, the variables are updated as described.**
