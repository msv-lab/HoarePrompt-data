Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value 0. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is an empty matrix with `n` rows, `frnds` is an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the value entered as raw input, `j` is 0.
