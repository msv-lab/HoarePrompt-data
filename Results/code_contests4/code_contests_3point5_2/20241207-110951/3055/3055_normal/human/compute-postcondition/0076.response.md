Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set. For each row `i` in `mtrx`, if the element at position `i, j+1` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', then `frnds` is updated by adding the value at position `i + 1, j+1`, `i, j - 1`, and `i, j + 1` in `mtrx` if all initial conditions and update conditions are met. If `i - 1 > 0`, the set `frnds` is updated accordingly based on the specified conditions. After the execution of the if else block, the set `frnds` will have the value `mtrx[i + 1][j]` added to it if `i + 1 < n`.***
