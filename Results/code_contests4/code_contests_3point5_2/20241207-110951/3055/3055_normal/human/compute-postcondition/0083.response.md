Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value. `frnds` is a set with added value at index `[i - 1][j]` updated by adding `mtrx[i][j + 1]` if `j + 1 < m`. If `j + 1 < m`, then `frnds` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, no changes occur in `frnds`.***
