According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the matrix `mtrx` needs to have `n` rows, `frnds` should be an empty set, `col` should be assigned a value, `j` should be equal to `m`, and `k` should be equal to `n` incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the raw input value, `j` is equal to the final value of `m`, `k` is equal to the final value of `n` incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `n` times**
