Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `frnds` have been updated based on the conditions met in the loop body for all iterations. The set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. The loop iterates through all elements of `mtrx` and adds adjacent elements to `frnds` based on the specified conditions. `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches `m`.**
