Example Answer:
`frnds` is updated by adding the value at position `i - 1, j` in `mtrx` if the element at position `i, j+1` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. The initial conditions are positive integers for `n`, `m`, and `c`, a matrix `mtrx` with `n` rows, and a set `frnds`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set with updated values based on the conditions met.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set with updated values based on the conditions met**
