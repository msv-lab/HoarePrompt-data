Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `mtrx`, `frnds`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with updated values based on the conditions met in the loop. The set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. `j` is equal to `m` and `k` is equal to `n+1`. There is at least one element '.' in the set `frnds`.***
