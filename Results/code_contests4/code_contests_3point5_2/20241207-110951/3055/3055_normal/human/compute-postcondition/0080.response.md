Example Answer: 
The value at index `[i - 1][j]` in `frnds` is updated by adding the value at index `[i][j - 1]` from the matrix `mtrx`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set with added value at index `[i - 1][j]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set with added value at index `[i - 1][j]`**
