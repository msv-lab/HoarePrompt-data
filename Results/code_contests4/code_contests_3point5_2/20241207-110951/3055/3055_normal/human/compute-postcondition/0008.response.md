According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. The initial value of `k` does not need adjustment. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is an empty matrix with `n` rows, `frnds` is an empty set, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
