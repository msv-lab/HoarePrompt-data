According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the new value of `m`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows extended by raw input value, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned raw input value, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than the new value of `n`, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `j` is less than the new value of `m`**
