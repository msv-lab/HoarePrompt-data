Example Answer:
The element at position (i, j + 1) in mtrx is added to frnds. The previous values of variables are n, m, c, i, j+1, frnds. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j+1`, `frnds`, element at position (i, j + 1) in mtrx is added to frnds.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j+1`, `frnds`, element at position (i, j + 1) in mtrx is added to frnds**
