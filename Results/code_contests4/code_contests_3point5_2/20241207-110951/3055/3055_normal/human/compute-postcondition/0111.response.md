Example Answer:
The element at position (i + 1, j) in mtrx is added to the set `frnds`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact element being added. Therefore, the Output State is: *`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j+1`, `frnds` were updated based on the conditions met in the loop body for the next iteration. If i - 1 > 0, the element at position (i - 1, j) in mtrx is added to frnds. Additionally, if j - 1 > 0, the element at position (i, j - 1) in mtrx is also added to frnds. If j + 1 < m, the element at position (i, j + 1) in mtrx is added to frnds; and the element at position (i + 1, j) in mtrx is added to `frnds`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j+1`, `frnds` were updated based on the conditions met in the loop body for the next iteration. If i - 1 > 0, the element at position (i - 1, j) in mtrx is added to frnds. Additionally, if j - 1 > 0, the element at position (i, j - 1) in mtrx is also added to frnds. If j + 1 < m, the element at position (i, j + 1) in mtrx is added to frnds; and the element at position (i + 1, j) in mtrx is added to `frnds`**
