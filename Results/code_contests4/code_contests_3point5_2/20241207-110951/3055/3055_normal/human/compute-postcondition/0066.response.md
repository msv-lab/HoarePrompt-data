Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set. For each row `i` in `mtrx`, if the element at position `i, j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', then `frnds` is updated by adding the value at position `i + 1, j` in `mtrx` if all initial conditions and update conditions are met. No changes occur if the else part is not executed.***
