According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `mtrx`, `c`, `i`, and `frnds`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and will be incremented by 1 after each iteration, `mtrx` has `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` has been modified based on the conditions provided. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be less than `m`. When the if condition is met, `mtrx[i][j]` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', `frnds` will have the value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]`, `mtrx[i][j - 1]`, and `mtrx[i][j + 1]` added to it. Additionally, `i` is greater than 1 and `i + 1 < n`, `frnds` will have the value `mtrx[i + 1][j]` added to it.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j+1`, `frnds` has the updated values based on the conditions met in the loop body for the next iteration**.
