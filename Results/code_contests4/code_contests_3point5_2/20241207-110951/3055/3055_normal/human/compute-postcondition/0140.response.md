Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `j - 1 > 0`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `i` are incremented by 1, `j` is -1, `frnds` set now contains the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]`. If `j + 1 < m`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j` are integers incremented by 1, `j` is -1, `frnds` set contains the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]` and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`. The loop executes the first time `m` is greater than 0, the element in the matrix at row `i` and column `j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.', `(i + 1 < n)`, `frnds` set now contains the value of `mtrx[i + 1][j]`.***
