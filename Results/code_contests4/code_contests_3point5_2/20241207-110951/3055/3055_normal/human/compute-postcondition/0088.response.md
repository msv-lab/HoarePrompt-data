According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, and the set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:
State: **`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, the set `frnds` contains all the elements in `mtrx` that are adjacent to an element equal to `c` and not equal to '.', for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1`**
