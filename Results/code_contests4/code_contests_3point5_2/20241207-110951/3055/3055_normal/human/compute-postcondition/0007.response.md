Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `int(False)`, which evaluates to 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is an empty matrix with `n` rows, `frnds` is an empty set, `k` is 0.
