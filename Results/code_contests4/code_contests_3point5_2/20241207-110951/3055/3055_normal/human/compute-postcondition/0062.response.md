Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is a set containing the value at position `i - 1, j` in `mtrx` if `i - 1 > 0`, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the raw input value, `j` is equal to the final value of `m`, `k` is equal to the final value of `n` incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `n` times, `j` is 0. The element at position `i, j` in `mtrx` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. Once the if condition `j - 1 > 0` is satisfied, `frnds` is updated by adding the value at position `i, j - 1` in `mtrx`. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j + 1 < m`, `j` is incremented by 1 and `frnds` is updated by adding the value at position `i, j` in `mtrx. `frnds` is updated by adding the value at position `i, j + 1` in `mtrx.***
