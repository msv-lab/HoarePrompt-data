According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is reset to 0, and `frnds` may be modified based on conditions. So, for the loop to execute, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
