Example Answer:
An empty matrix `mtrx` is created with `n` number of rows. The dimensions of the matrix are determined by the positive integers `n` and `m`. The matrix is currently empty, and the President's desk colour `c` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is an empty matrix with `n` rows.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the office-room matrix, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter representing the President's desk colour, `mtrx` is an empty matrix with `n` rows**
