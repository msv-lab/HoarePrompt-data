Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `i` are incremented by 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0. The element in the matrix at row `i` and column `j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'. Additionally, if `i - 1` is greater than 0, `frnds` set now contains the value of `mtrx[i - 1][j]`. The value of `j` is decremented by 1 and is greater than 0***
