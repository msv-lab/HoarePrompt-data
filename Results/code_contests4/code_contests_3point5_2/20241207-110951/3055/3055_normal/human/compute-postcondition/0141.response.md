According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `m`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions specified in the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows:
- `j - 1 > 0`
- `m` is greater than 0
- The element in the matrix at row `i` and column `j` is equal to `c` and not equal to '.'
- `(i + 1) < n`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `j - 1 > 0`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `i` need to be incremented by 1, `j` needs to be set to -1, and `frnds` set should now contain the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `j + 1 < m`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j` need to be incremented by 1, `j` needs to be set to -1, `frnds` set should contain the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]` and `mtrx[i][j + 1]`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `c`, `i` are incremented by 1, `j` is -1, `frnds` set contains the value of `mtrx[i][j - 1]`.**
