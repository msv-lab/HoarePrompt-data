According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. `m` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 4. Additionally, `k` is equal to the final value of `n` where `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `c` is a single uppercase Latin letter, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value, `frnds` is an empty set, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is assigned the raw input value, `j` is 3, `k` is equal to the final value of `n` where `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute again, for the loop to execute again `m` is greater than or equal to 4**
