Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c` are positive integers, `mtrx` is a matrix with `n` rows each extended by the raw input value. If `mtrx[i][j] == c` and `mtrx[i][j] != '.'`, and `i + 1 < n` and `j < m`, then `frnds` is updated by adding `mtrx[i + 1][j]`. If the conditions are not met, `frnds` remains unchanged.***
