Example Answer:
'k' is assigned the value of 'k' plus 1. Since 'k' is equal to the final value of 'n', the new value of 'k' will be one more than the final value of 'n'. The value of 'j' remains equal to 'm'. Therefore, the Output State is: 'j' is equal to 'm', 'k' is equal to the final value of 'n' plus 1.
Output State: **'j' is equal to 'm', 'k' is equal to the final value of 'n' plus 1**
