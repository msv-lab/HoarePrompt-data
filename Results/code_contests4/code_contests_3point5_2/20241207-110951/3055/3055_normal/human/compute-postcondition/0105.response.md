Example Answer:
The value at position (i - 1, j) in the matrix mtrx is added to the set frnds. The values of n, m, c, i, j+1 are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, c, i, j+1, frnds has the updated values based on the conditions met in the loop body for the next iteration and the element at position (i - 1, j) in mtrx is added to frnds.
Output State: **n, m, c, i, j+1, frnds has the updated values based on the conditions met in the loop body for the next iteration and the element at position (i - 1, j) in mtrx is added to frnds.**
