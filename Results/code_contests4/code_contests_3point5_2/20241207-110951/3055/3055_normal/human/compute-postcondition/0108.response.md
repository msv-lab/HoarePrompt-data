Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `c`, `i`, `j+1`, `frnds` have updated values based on the conditions met in the loop body for the next iteration. If i - 1 > 0, the element at position (i - 1, j) in mtrx is added to frnds. Additionally, if j - 1 > 0, the element at position (i, j - 1) in mtrx is also added to frnds.***
