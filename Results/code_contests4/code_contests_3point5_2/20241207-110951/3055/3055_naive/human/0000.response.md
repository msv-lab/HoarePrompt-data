Correctness: **False**

In the given program, the logic to determine the number of President's deputies is not correct. The program does not correctly identify the deputies who have desks adjacent to the President's desk. 

For example, if we consider the following input:
```
3 4 R
G.B.
.RR.
TTT.
```
The correct output should be 2, as there are two desks adjacent to the President's desk with the color 'R'. However, the program provided may not output the correct result for this input.

Therefore, based on the incorrect logic of identifying deputies, the program is incorrect.
