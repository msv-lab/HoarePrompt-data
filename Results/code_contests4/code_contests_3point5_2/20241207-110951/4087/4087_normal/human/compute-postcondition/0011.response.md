Example Answer:
`tmp` is multiplied by the value of `i`, which is `n + 2`. The previous value of `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, after execution, `tmp` will be the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n` by `n + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n` by `n + 2`, `i` is `n + 2`**
