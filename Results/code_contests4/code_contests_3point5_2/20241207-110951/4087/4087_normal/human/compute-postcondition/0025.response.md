Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the index of `a[i]` in the list `a`. The value of `i` and the elements in `a` are unknown, so the specific values of `x` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, `left` is assigned the value of `i+1` and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+1]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `left` is assigned the value of `i+1` and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+1]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`**
