At the end of the last iteration, `left` is assigned the value of `i` and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+1]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `a[i]` should not be found in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`.
State: **After the execution of the if else block, `left` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+2]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`.**
