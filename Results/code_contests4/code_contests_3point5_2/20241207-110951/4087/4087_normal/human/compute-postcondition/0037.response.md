According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the conditions to be adjusted are:
`left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list must be set appropriately based on list `a`,
`right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence must be set appropriately based on list `a`,
`pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of the factorial of `i` must be recalculated for the new size,
`tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2` must be recalculated with the updated value of `n`.

State: **`n` is input integer, `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list, `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with factorials of 0 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
