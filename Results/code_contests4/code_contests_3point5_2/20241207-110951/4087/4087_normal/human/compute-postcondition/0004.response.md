Example Answer:
The variable `mask` is assigned the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a large number. The values of `n`, `left`, and `right` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007**
