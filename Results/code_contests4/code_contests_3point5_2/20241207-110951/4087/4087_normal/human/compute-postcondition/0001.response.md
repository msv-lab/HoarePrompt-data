Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input string based on whitespaces. The `map` function returns an iterator, so the actual values of `a` cannot be determined at this stage. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer.
Output State: **n is an input integer**
