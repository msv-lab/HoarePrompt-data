According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of `tmp`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n` by `n + 2`, and `i` is `n + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increase by 1 and should be within the range of `1` to `n + 1`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of `tmp`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n` by `n + 2`, `i` is `n + 3` for the loop to execute one more time**
