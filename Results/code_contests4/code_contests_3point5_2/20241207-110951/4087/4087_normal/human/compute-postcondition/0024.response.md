According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is assigned the value of `i` and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. The program then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

To adjust for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **After the execution of the if else block, `left` is assigned the value of `i+1` and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+1]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`.**
