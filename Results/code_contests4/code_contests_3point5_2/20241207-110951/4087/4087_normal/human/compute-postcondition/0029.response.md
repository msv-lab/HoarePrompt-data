Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `left` is assigned the value of `i`, and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+1]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. If `a[i]` is found in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
