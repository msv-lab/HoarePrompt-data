Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value of the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`, added to `x + 1`. The values of `left`, `i`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is assigned the value of `i`, `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+2]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`.
Output State: **`left` is assigned the value of `i`, `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+2]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`**
