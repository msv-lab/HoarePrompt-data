According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 0. Before the loop starts, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of the factorial of `i`, and `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`. To ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of the factorial of `i`, and `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`.
