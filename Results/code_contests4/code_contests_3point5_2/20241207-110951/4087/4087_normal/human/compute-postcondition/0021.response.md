Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value of the index of element `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`. The value of `i` is used to find the element to search for in the sublist. The index of the element is calculated by taking the index of the element in the sublist and adding `x + 1` to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is assigned the value of `i`, `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`.
Output State: **`left` is assigned the value of `i`, `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`**
