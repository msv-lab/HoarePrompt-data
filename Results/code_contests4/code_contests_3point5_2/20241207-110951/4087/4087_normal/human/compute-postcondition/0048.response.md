Example Answer:
The code calculates `ans` based on the formula `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])` and `x` based on the formula `x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])`. Then it prints the result of `(ans - x) % mask`. The output state is determined by the calculations of `ans` and `x` using the provided formulas.
Output State: **Depends on the calculation of `ans` and `x` using the given formulas**
