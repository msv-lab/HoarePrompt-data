Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value of the index of `a[i]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`, and then adding `x + 1`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: After the execution of the if else block, `left` is assigned the value of `i`, and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+1]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `left` is assigned the value of `i`, and `right` is calculated based on the index of `a[i+1]` in the sublist of `a` starting from index `x + 1`**
