According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size n + 2 filled with zeros, and `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to n. The loop will execute one more time for `i` equal to `n + 2`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size n + 2 filled with zeros, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to n, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be `n + 2`**
