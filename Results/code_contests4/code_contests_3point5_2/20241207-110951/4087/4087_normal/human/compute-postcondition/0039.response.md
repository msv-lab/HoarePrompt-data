Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value calculated using the variables `pow`, `left`, `right`, and `i`. The values of these variables are already defined based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is input integer, `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list, `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with factorials of 0 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `ans` is assigned the value of `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`, `x` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`n` is input integer, `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list, `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with factorials of 0 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `ans` is assigned the value of `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`, `x` is calculated based on the formula**
