Output State: `n` is input integer, `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list, `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with factorials of 0 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop performs calculations to obtain `ans` and `x` using specific formulas and prints the result of `(ans - x) % mask` for each iteration of the loop.
