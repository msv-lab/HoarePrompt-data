According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the input integer. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, `ans` should be updated based on the new value of `i`, and `x` should be recalculated based on the formula.
State: **`n` is input integer, `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list, `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with factorials of 0 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is assigned the value of `pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])`, and `x` is calculated based on the formula**.
