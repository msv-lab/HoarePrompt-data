Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

1. The program calculates the factorial of numbers using a list `pow`, but it should be using the modulo 10^9+7 operation to avoid overflow.
2. The logic to calculate `ans` and `x` is incorrect. The division operation `/` should be replaced by the modulo operation `%` to ensure the result is within the modulo 10^9+7.
3. The program does not handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the same value in the sequence. It only considers the first occurrence and the next occurrence of the same value. This will lead to incorrect results for sequences with more than two occurrences of the same value.
