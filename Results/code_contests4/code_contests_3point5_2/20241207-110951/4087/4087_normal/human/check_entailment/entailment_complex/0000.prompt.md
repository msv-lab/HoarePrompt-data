You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an integer sequence of length n+1, a_1,a_2,...,a_{n+1}, which consists of the n integers 1,...,n. It is known that each of the n integers 1,...,n appears at least once in this sequence.

For each integer k=1,...,n+1, find the number of the different subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

* 1 \leq n \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq a_i \leq n
* Each of the integers 1,...,n appears in the sequence.
* n and a_i are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


n
a_1 a_2 ... a_{n+1}


Output

Print n+1 lines. The k-th line should contain the number of the different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= n. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, re.split('\\s', raw_input()))
    left = 0
    right = 0
    mask = 10 ** 9 + 7
    pow = [0] * n + 2
    tmp = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 2):
        tmp *= i
        
        pow[i] = tmp
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of the factorial of `i`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        x = a.index(a[i])
        
        if a[i] in a[x + 1:]:
            left = i
            right = a[x + 1:].index(a[i]) + x + 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list, `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with zeros except for `pow[i]` which is assigned the value of the factorial of `i`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`
    for i in range(1, n + 2):
        ans = pow[n + 1] / (pow[i] * pow[n + 1 - i])
        
        x = pow[left + n - right] / (pow[i - 1] * pow[left + n - right - i + 1])
        
        print(ans - x) % mask
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is input integer, `left` is the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` that is repeated later in the list, `right` is the index of the second occurrence of that value in the list after the first occurrence, `mask` is 1000000007, `pow` is a list of size `n + 2` filled with factorials of 0 to `n + 1`, `tmp` is the result of multiplying all integers from 1 to `n + 2`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop performs calculations to obtain `ans` and `x` using specific formulas and prints the result of `(ans - x) % mask` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` followed by a sequence of integers. It then calculates specific values based on the input sequence and prints the results. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but processes the input sequence to perform calculations and output results.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
