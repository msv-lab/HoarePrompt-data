Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The algorithm used in the program does not correctly calculate the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k. The calculations in the second for loop are not correct based on the problem requirements.

The program does not handle all potential cases where the subsequences are not contiguous correctly. This results in incorrect output for some test cases.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
