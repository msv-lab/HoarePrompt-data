Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of different subsequences of the given sequence with length k. The logic in the program seems to be incorrect and does not adhere to the problem description.

Explanation:
1. The calculation of permutations seems incorrect as it uses division instead of modulo operation.
2. The calculation of `x` is not correct and does not seem to align with the problem description.
3. The use of the `index` function may not work correctly in all cases.
4. The logic to find the left and right indices based on the given condition is not implemented properly.
5. The program does not handle all potential edge cases which may lead to incorrect output.
