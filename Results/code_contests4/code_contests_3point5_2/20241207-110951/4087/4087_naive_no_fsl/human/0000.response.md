Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. Here are some reasons why:

1. The program is using `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.
2. The variable `re` is used without being imported. There is no import statement for the `re` module.
3. The calculation of `ans` and `x` is incorrect. The division operation `/` is used instead of integer division `//`.
4. The modulo operation `%` is not applied correctly to the print statement.

Overall, the program has syntax errors and incorrect logic in the calculations.
