Correctness: **True**

The program takes input for the number of ordered bottles, the volume of each bottle, and the number of friends in the company. It then calculates the distribution of milk among the cups ensuring that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups. The program outputs "YES" if a solution is possible, and it shows the distribution of milk if a solution exists.

The program logic seems correct as it properly distributes the milk among the cups according to the constraints provided in the problem description. It handles the pouring of milk from bottles to cups in a way that satisfies the conditions specified. The program also performs input validation and outputs the correct results based on the calculated distribution.

Overall, the program seems to be correctly implementing the requirements of the problem description.
