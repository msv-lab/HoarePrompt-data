Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes three integers n, w, and m as input and then proceeds to distribute the milk among the cups as per the described conditions.
- It uses classes `Bottle` and `Cup` to represent the bottles and cups respectively.
- The `func_2` function is used to pour milk from a bottle to a cup ensuring that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups.
- The `func_3` function initializes the bottles and cups, distributes the milk, and returns the content of each cup.
- The program checks if it is possible to distribute the milk according to the conditions and prints the output accordingly.
- The input constraints are enforced and the output format is as specified in the problem description.
- The program logic ensures that the milk is distributed evenly among the cups, respecting the constraints mentioned in the problem statement.
