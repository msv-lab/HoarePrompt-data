Example Answer:
The list `bottles` is created with `n` elements, where each element is an instance of the `Bottle` class with index `i + 1` and weight `w`. The values of `n` and `w` are given, so the list `bottles` will have `n` elements with weights `w` each.
Output State: **bottles is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w**
