According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci` and `cups[ci].is_full()`. If `ci + 1` is less than `m` and `cups[ci]` is full, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ci` is incremented by 1 and `cups[ci]` is full. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `ci` needs to be such that `ci + 1` is less than `m` and `cups[ci+1]` is full. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is incremented by 1, `bi` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`, `ci` such that `ci + 1` is less than m and `cups[ci+1]` is full**
