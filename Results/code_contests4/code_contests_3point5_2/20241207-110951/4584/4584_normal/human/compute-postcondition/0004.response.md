According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `bi` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `Cup.capacity` is already calculated, `cups` is a list of Cup instances, and `ci` is 0.
State: **`bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is 0, for the loop to execute `bi` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0**
