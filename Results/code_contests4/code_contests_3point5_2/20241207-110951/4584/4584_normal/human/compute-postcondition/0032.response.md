According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ci` and `cups`. If `ci + 1` is less than `m` and `cups[ci]` is full, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `ci` is the maximum value such that `ci + 1` is less than `m` and `cups[ci]` is full. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
1. `ci` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `ci + 1 < m`.
2. The cup at index `ci` needs to be emptied to no longer satisfy the condition `cups[ci].is_full()`.

State: **`bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is the next value such that `ci + 1` is less than m, `cups[ci]` is empty, `bi` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`. If `bottle` is not empty, the function returns an empty list []. Otherwise, it returns None.**
