Postcondition: ***`bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is 0, `bi` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[bi]`, `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`, `ci` is less than m, and `bi` is still 0. If `bottle` is not empty, the program executes the if block. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program after the if else block.***
