Example Answer:
The variable `Cup.capacity` is assigned the value of the expression `float(n * w) / float(m)`. The value of `n` represents the number of Bottle instances in the list `bottles`, and `w` represents the weight of each Bottle instance. The value of `m` is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `Cup.capacity`. Therefore, the Output State is: `bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated based on the provided formula.
Output State: **`bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated based on the provided formula**
