Example Answer:
`ci` is incremented by 1, where `ci` was less than `m - 1`. Since `ci` is now increased by 1, the cup at index `ci` might be full now. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: bottles is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, Cup.capacity is calculated, cups is a list of m Cup instances, ci is now incremented by 1, bi is 2, n is greater than 1, bottle is the second element in the list bottles.
Output State: **bottles is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, Cup.capacity is calculated, cups is a list of m Cup instances, ci is now incremented by 1, bi is 2, n is greater than 1, bottle is the second element in the list bottles**
