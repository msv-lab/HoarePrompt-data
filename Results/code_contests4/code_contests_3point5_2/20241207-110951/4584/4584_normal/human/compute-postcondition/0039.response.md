According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bi` and `n`. If `bi` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is the value such that `ci + 1` is equal to m or greater, `cups[ci]` is either empty or not full, `bi` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`. If `bottle` is not empty, the function returns an empty list []. Otherwise, it returns None. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `bi` needs to be incremented by 1 and `bi` must be less than `n`.
State: **`bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is the value such that `ci + 1` is equal to m or greater, `cups[ci]` is either empty or not full, `bi` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`**.
