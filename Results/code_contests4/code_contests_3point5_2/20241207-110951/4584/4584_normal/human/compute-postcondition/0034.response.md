According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the conditions `ci + 1 < m` and `cups[ci].is_full()`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `ci` needs to be adjusted to the next value such that `ci + 1` is less than `m`.
2. `cups[ci]` needs to be adjusted to be empty.
3. `bi` needs to be adjusted to 1.
4. `bottle` needs to be reassigned the value of `bottles[1]`.
5. `func_2` needs to be called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`, and its return value needs to be checked.
6. If the function `func_2` returns an empty list `[]`, then `cups[ci]` is not full, and the loop can execute again.

State: **Output State: `bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is the next value such that `ci + 1` is less than m, `cups[ci]` is empty, `bi` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[1]`, `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`, and if the function returns an empty list, `ci` is incremented by 1**
