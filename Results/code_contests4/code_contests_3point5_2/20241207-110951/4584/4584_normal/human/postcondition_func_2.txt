The function func_3 accepts three integer parameters n, w, and m, where n ranges from 1 to 50, w ranges from 100 to 1000, and m ranges from 2 to 50. It creates instances of Bottle and Cup classes based on the parameters provided. Then, it iterates through the bottles and cups, calling func_2 with specific conditions. If certain conditions are met during the iteration, the function returns an empty list. Finally, it returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the cups list. The functionality of the function includes handling different cases during the iteration and returning the list of ingredients at the end.
