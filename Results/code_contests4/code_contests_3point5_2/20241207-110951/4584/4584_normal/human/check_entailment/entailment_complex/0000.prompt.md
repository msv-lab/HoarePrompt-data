You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Students love to celebrate their holidays. Especially if the holiday is the day of the end of exams!

Despite the fact that Igor K., unlike his groupmates, failed to pass a programming test, he decided to invite them to go to a cafe so that each of them could drink a bottle of... fresh cow milk. Having entered the cafe, the m friends found n different kinds of milk on the menu, that's why they ordered n bottles — one bottle of each kind. We know that the volume of milk in each bottle equals w.

When the bottles were brought in, they decided to pour all the milk evenly among the m cups, so that each got a cup. As a punishment for not passing the test Igor was appointed the person to pour the milk. He protested that he was afraid to mix something up and suggested to distribute the drink so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. His friends agreed but they suddenly faced the following problem — and what is actually the way to do it?

Help them and write the program that will help to distribute the milk among the cups and drink it as quickly as possible!

Note that due to Igor K.'s perfectly accurate eye and unswerving hands, he can pour any fractional amount of milk from any bottle to any cup.

Input

The only input data file contains three integers n, w and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 50), where n stands for the number of ordered bottles, w stands for the volume of each of them and m stands for the number of friends in the company.

Output

Print on the first line "YES" if it is possible to pour the milk so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. If there's no solution, print "NO".

If there is a solution, then print m more lines, where the i-th of them describes the content of the i-th student's cup. The line should consist of one or more pairs that would look like "b v". Each such pair means that v (v > 0) units of milk were poured into the i-th cup from bottle b (1 ≤ b ≤ n). All numbers b on each line should be different.

If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. Print the real numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.**
def func_1(x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -x < eps
        #The program returns whether the absolute value of x is less than eps or not.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *x is a list of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. The values in x are greater than or equal to 0
    return x < eps
    #The program returns whether the list x is less than epsilon (eps)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `x` of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints for these integers are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. The function returns whether the absolute value of x is less than epsilon (eps) or if the list x is less than epsilon (eps). However, the code has a potential issue as it compares a list `x` directly to epsilon (eps), which might not be the intended behavior based on the annotations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, w, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.**
def func_2(bottle, cup):
    if (bottle.is_empty() or cup.is_full()) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n, w, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. The bottle is not empty and the cup is not full.
    space_in_cup = cup.space_left()
    if (bottle.milk <= space_in_cup) :
        cup.milk += bottle.milk
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, bottle.milk))
        bottle.milk = 0.0
    else :
        bottle.milk -= space_in_cup
        cup.milk = cup.capacity
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, space_in_cup))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n, w, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. If the bottle is not empty and the cup is full with no space left, then the amount of milk in the cup increases by the amount of milk in the bottle. Otherwise, if the bottle is not empty, the cup has more milk, the bottle has less milk, and there is still space left in the cup.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the conditions specified for the amount of milk in the bottle and cup are met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `bottle` and `cup`, both of which are objects. The function checks if the bottle is not empty and the cup is not full. If these conditions are met, it adds the milk from the bottle to the cup, updates the ingredients list, and returns True. If the conditions are not met, the function returns False. The functionality also includes handling scenarios where the bottle has more milk than the space left in the cup by reducing the milk in the bottle and filling the cup to its capacity.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, w, and m are all integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.**
def func_3(n, w, m):
    bottles = [Bottle(i + 1, w) for i in range(n)]
    Cup.capacity = float(n * w) / float(m)
    cups = [Cup() for i in range(m)]
    ci = 0
    for bi in range(n):
        bottle = bottles[bi]
        
        func_2(bottle, cups[ci])
        
        if not bottle.is_empty():
            if ci + 1 > m:
                return []
            func_2(bottle, cups[ci + 1])
            if not bottle.is_empty():
                return []
        
        while ci + 1 < m and cups[ci].is_full():
            ci += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `bottles` is a list of n Bottle instances with weights w, `Cup.capacity` is calculated, `cups` is a list of m Cup instances, `ci` is the maximum value such that `ci + 1` is less than or equal to m and `cups[ci]` is either empty or not full, `bi` is equal to n - 1, `n` is a positive integer, `bottle` is assigned the value of `bottles[n-1]`, `func_2` is called with arguments `bottle` and `cups[ci]`
    return [cup.ingridients for cup in cups]
    #The program returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list `cups`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts three integer parameters n, w, and m, where n ranges from 1 to 50, w ranges from 100 to 1000, and m ranges from 2 to 50. It creates instances of Bottle and Cup classes based on the parameters provided. Then, it iterates through the bottles and cups, calling func_2 with specific conditions. If certain conditions are met during the iteration, the function returns an empty list. Finally, it returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the cups list. The functionality of the function includes handling different cases during the iteration and returning the list of ingredients at the end.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
