Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of three functions:
- Function 1: Checks if a list of three integers is less than a threshold value epsilon.
- Function 2: Distributes milk from a bottle to a cup ensuring that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups.
- Function 3: Creates instances of bottles and cups, calculates the capacity of each cup, and distributes the milk among the cups using Function 2.

The program is correct as it follows the problem description by distributing the milk among the cups such that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups. It ensures that the milk is poured in a feasible manner according to the given constraints. The output matches the expected output format specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
