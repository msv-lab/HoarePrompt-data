You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Students love to celebrate their holidays. Especially if the holiday is the day of the end of exams!

Despite the fact that Igor K., unlike his groupmates, failed to pass a programming test, he decided to invite them to go to a cafe so that each of them could drink a bottle of... fresh cow milk. Having entered the cafe, the m friends found n different kinds of milk on the menu, that's why they ordered n bottles — one bottle of each kind. We know that the volume of milk in each bottle equals w.

When the bottles were brought in, they decided to pour all the milk evenly among the m cups, so that each got a cup. As a punishment for not passing the test Igor was appointed the person to pour the milk. He protested that he was afraid to mix something up and suggested to distribute the drink so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. His friends agreed but they suddenly faced the following problem — and what is actually the way to do it?

Help them and write the program that will help to distribute the milk among the cups and drink it as quickly as possible!

Note that due to Igor K.'s perfectly accurate eye and unswerving hands, he can pour any fractional amount of milk from any bottle to any cup.

Input

The only input data file contains three integers n, w and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 50), where n stands for the number of ordered bottles, w stands for the volume of each of them and m stands for the number of friends in the company.

Output

Print on the first line "YES" if it is possible to pour the milk so that the milk from each bottle was in no more than two different cups. If there's no solution, print "NO".

If there is a solution, then print m more lines, where the i-th of them describes the content of the i-th student's cup. The line should consist of one or more pairs that would look like "b v". Each such pair means that v (v > 0) units of milk were poured into the i-th cup from bottle b (1 ≤ b ≤ n). All numbers b on each line should be different.

If there are several variants to solve the problem, print any of them. Print the real numbers with no less than 6 digits after the decimal point.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.**
def func_1(x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -x < eps
        #The program returns whether the absolute value of x is less than eps or not.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *x is a list of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. The values in x are greater than or equal to 0
    return x < eps
    #The program returns whether the list x is less than epsilon (eps)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, w, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.**
def func_2(bottle, cup):
    if (bottle.is_empty() or cup.is_full()) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n, w, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. The bottle is not empty and the cup is not full.
    space_in_cup = cup.space_left()
    if (bottle.milk <= space_in_cup) :
        cup.milk += bottle.milk
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, bottle.milk))
        bottle.milk = 0.0
    else :
        bottle.milk -= space_in_cup
        cup.milk = cup.capacity
        cup.ingridients.append((bottle.no, space_in_cup))
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n, w, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. If the bottle is not empty and the cup is full with no space left, then the amount of milk in the cup increases by the amount of milk in the bottle. Otherwise, if the bottle is not empty, the cup has more milk, the bottle has less milk, and there is still space left in the cup.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the conditions specified for the amount of milk in the bottle and cup are met.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, w, and m are all integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.**

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
