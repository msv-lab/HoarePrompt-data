Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes three integers n, w, and m as input, where n represents the number of ordered bottles, w represents the volume of each bottle, and m represents the number of friends in the company. The constraints for these integers are met as specified in the problem description.
- The code creates instances of the Bottle and Cup classes and distributes the milk among the cups based on Igor K.'s requirements. It follows the logic of pouring the milk from each bottle into no more than two different cups as specified in the problem description.
- The program checks for conditions where a bottle is empty or a cup is full and handles those scenarios accordingly. It also ensures that the milk from each bottle is poured into the cups evenly and accurately.
- The output format is in accordance with the problem description, where it prints "YES" if a solution is possible along with the distribution of milk among the cups, or "NO" if there is no solution. The output includes the content of each student's cup in the desired format.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the solution to the given problem and follows the problem description for every potential case.
