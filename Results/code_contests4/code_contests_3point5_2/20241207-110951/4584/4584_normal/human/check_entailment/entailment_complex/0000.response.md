Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines functions to handle the distribution of milk among cups based on the problem description.
- The func_1 function checks if a given list of three integers is less than epsilon (eps).
- The func_2 function handles the pouring of milk from a bottle to a cup ensuring that the milk from each bottle is in no more than two different cups.
- The func_3 function creates instances of Bottle and Cup classes and distributes the milk among the cups according to the specified conditions.
- The code structure and the functions implemented align with the problem description and ensure that the milk is distributed among the cups as required.
