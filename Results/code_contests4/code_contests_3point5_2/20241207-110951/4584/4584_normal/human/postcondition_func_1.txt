The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `bottle` and `cup`, both of which are objects. The function checks if the bottle is not empty and the cup is not full. If these conditions are met, it adds the milk from the bottle to the cup, updates the ingredients list, and returns True. If the conditions are not met, the function returns False. The functionality also includes handling scenarios where the bottle has more milk than the space left in the cup by reducing the milk in the bottle and filling the cup to its capacity.
