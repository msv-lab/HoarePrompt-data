#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50.**

    #The program returns whether the list x is less than epsilon (eps)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `x` of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints for these integers are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. The function returns whether the absolute value of x is less than epsilon (eps) or if the list x is less than epsilon (eps). However, the code has a potential issue as it compares a list `x` directly to epsilon (eps), which might not be the intended behavior based on the annotations.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n, w, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. If the bottle is not empty and the cup is full with no space left, then the amount of milk in the cup increases by the amount of milk in the bottle. Otherwise, if the bottle is not empty, the cup has more milk, the bottle has less milk, and there is still space left in the cup.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the conditions specified for the amount of milk in the bottle and cup are met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `bottle` and `cup`, both of which are objects. The function checks if the bottle is not empty and the cup is not full. If these conditions are met, it adds the milk from the bottle to the cup, updates the ingredients list, and returns True. If the conditions are not met, the function returns False. The functionality also includes handling scenarios where the bottle has more milk than the space left in the cup by reducing the milk in the bottle and filling the cup to its capacity.

    #The program returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the list `cups`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts three integer parameters n, w, and m, where n ranges from 1 to 50, w ranges from 100 to 1000, and m ranges from 2 to 50. It creates instances of Bottle and Cup classes based on the parameters provided. Then, it iterates through the bottles and cups, calling func_2 with specific conditions. If certain conditions are met during the iteration, the function returns an empty list. Finally, it returns a list of ingredients for each cup in the cups list. The functionality of the function includes handling different cases during the iteration and returning the list of ingredients at the end.
