The function `func_1` accepts a list `x` of three integers representing the number of ordered bottles (n), volume of each bottle (w), and number of friends in the company (m). The constraints for these integers are 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 100 ≤ w ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ m ≤ 50. The function returns whether the absolute value of x is less than epsilon (eps) or if the list x is less than epsilon (eps). However, the code has a potential issue as it compares a list `x` directly to epsilon (eps), which might not be the intended behavior based on the annotations.
