Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly constructs a binary string `s` of length `n = a + b` such that there are exactly `a` zeroes, exactly `b` ones, and exactly `x` indices `i` such that `s_i â‰  s_{i + 1}`. The program handles the cases where `x > 1 and a == 1` and `x = 1` separately to ensure the conditions are met. It then iterates through the remaining indices to add the required number of zeroes and ones accordingly. The final string `s` is printed as the output. The program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
