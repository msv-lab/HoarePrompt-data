Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly constructs a binary string s of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones, and exactly x indices i (where 1 ≤ i < n) such that s_i ≠ s_{i + 1}. The program handles the cases where a = 1 separately to ensure the conditions are met. It then iteratively appends 0s and 1s to the string s based on the current character, the remaining counts of a and b, and the remaining required differing indices x. Finally, it appends the remaining 0s and 1s to satisfy the length of the string n. The output string s meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
