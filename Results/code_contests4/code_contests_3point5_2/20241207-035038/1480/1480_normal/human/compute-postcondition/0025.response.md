Example Answer: 
`s` is concatenated with '1', so if `s` was '0', it becomes '01'. The loop will execute again as `x` is still greater than 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `x` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10', and `s` has been concatenated with '1'.
Output State: **`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10' and `s` has been concatenated with '1'**
