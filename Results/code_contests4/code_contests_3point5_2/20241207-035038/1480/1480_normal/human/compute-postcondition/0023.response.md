Output State: **`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `s[-1] == '0'`, then `s` is appended with '1' and `b` is decreased by 1. If `s[-1] != '0'`, then `a` is between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, and `s` is either '0' or '10'.**
