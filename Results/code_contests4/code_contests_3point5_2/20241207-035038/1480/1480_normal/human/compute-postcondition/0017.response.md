According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `a`, `b`, and `x` have certain constraints. To adjust the states for the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1'. For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be greater than 1**
