Example Answer:
`s` is concatenated with '1', so the new value of `s` will be the original value of `s` with '1' added at the end. Since the last character of `s` is '0', after concatenation, the new value of `s` will end with '01'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b`, `s` is either '0' or '1'. The last character of `s` is '01'.
Output State: **`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b`, `s` is either '0' or '1'. The last character of `s` is '01'**
