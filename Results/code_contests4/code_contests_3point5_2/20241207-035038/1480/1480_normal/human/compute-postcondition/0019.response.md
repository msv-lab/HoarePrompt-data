Example Answer:
The value of `b` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `b` is unknown, so the output state is: `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1'. `s` is appended with '1', `b` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1'. `s` is appended with '1', `b` is decreased by 1**
