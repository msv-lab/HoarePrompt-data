Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decremented by 1. Since `a` was initially between 1 and 100, after the decrement operation, `a` will be between 0 and 99. The other variables `b`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 99, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, `s` is either '0' or '10', `s[-1]` is not equal to '0'.
Output State: **1 ≤ `a` ≤ 99, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, `s` is either '0' or '10', `s[-1]` is not equal to '0'**
