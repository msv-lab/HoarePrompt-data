The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of integers `a` and `b` and returns the result. The values of `a` and `b` are restricted to integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. The function does not take any input parameters and simply returns the sum of `a` and `b`. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of integers a and b, where a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and returns the result.**
