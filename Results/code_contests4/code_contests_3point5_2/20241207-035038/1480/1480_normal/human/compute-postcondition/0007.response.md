Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`. If `x` > 1 and `a` == 1, then `a` becomes 1, `b` decreases by 1, `x` remains greater than 1, and `s` is assigned the string '1'. If the condition (x > 1 and a == 1) is false, then `a` decreases by 1, `b` and `x` remain unchanged, `s` is still '0'.***
