Example Answer: 
's' is concatenated with '1' repeated 'b' times. Since 's[-1]' is '0', 's' has been concatenated with '1' repeated 'b' times. The previous values of 'a', 'b', and 'x' are still within their specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10', and 's' has been concatenated with '1' repeated 'b' times.
Output State: **'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10', 's' has been concatenated with '1' repeated 'b' times**
