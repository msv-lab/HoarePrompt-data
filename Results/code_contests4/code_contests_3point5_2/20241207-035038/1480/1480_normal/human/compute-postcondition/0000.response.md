Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `x` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. Since the input values are integers within the given range constraints, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b**.
