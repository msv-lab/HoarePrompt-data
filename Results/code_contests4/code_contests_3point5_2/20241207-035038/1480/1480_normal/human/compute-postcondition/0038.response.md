Postcondition: ***'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10'. If 's[-1]' is '0', then 's' has been concatenated with '1' repeated 'b' times and '0' repeated 'a' times. If 's[-1]' is not '0', then 'a' is between 0 and 99, 'b' is between 0 and 100. 's' is concatenated with '0' repeated 'a' times and '1' repeated between 0 and 100 times.***
