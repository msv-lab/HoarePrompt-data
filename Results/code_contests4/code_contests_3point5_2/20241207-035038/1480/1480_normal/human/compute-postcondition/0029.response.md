Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10'. If s[-1] == '0', then `s` has been concatenated with '1'. If s[-1] is not '0', `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10' and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1, `s` is concatenated with '0'.***
