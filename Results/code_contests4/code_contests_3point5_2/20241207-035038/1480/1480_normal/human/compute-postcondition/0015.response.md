Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b`, `s` is either '0' or '1'. If the last character of `s` is '0', then `b` is between 0 and 99. If the last character of `s` is not '0', then 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 99, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `x` < `a` + `b`, and `s` is either '0' or '10'.***
