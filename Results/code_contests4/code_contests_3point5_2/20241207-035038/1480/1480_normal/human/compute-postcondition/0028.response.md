Example Answer:
`a` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state allows `a` to be between 1 and 100, after the execution, `a` will have a value between 0 and 99. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10' and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1, `s` is concatenated with '0'.
Output State: **`a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10' and for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than 1, `s` is concatenated with '0'**
