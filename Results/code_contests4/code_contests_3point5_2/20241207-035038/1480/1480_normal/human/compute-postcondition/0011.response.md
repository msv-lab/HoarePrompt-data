Example Answer:
The value of `b` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state of `b` is between 1 and 100, the new value of `b` will be between 0 and 99. The other variables `a`, `x`, and `s` remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b`, `s` is either '0' or '1'. The last character of `s` is '01', `b` is between 0 and 99**
