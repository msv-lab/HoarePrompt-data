Output State: **'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10'. If 's[-1]' is '0', then 's' has been concatenated with '1', 'b' is between 0 and 99. If 's[-1]' is not '0', then 'a' is between 0 and 99, 'b' is between 0 and 100.**
