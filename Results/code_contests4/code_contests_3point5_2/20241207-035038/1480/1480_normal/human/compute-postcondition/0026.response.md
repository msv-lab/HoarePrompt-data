Example Answer:
`b` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `b` is between 1 and 100, so after execution, the new value of `b` will be between 0 and 99. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10' and `s` has been concatenated with '1'.
Output State: **`a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '1' or '10' and `s` has been concatenated with '1'**
