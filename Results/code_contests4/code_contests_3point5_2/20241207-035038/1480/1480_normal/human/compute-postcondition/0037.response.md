Example Answer: 
The code concatenates '1' repeated 'b' times to the string 's'. Since 'b' is between 0 and 100, the resulting string 's' will have '1's repeated between 0 and 100 times. The other variables 'a', 'b', and 'x' remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10'. If 's[-1]' is not '0', then 'a' is between 0 and 99, 'b' is between 0 and 100. 's' is concatenated with '0' repeated 'a' times and '1' repeated between 0 and 100 times.
Output State: **'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10'. If 's[-1]' is not '0', then 'a' is between 0 and 99, 'b' is between 0 and 100. 's' is concatenated with '0' repeated 'a' times and '1' repeated between 0 and 100 times.**
