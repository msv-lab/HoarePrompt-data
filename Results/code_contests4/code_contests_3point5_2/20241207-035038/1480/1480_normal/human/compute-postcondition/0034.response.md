Example Answer:
's' is concatenated with '0' repeated 'a' times. The value of 'a' can be between 0 and 100, so 's' will have '0' repeated 'a' times concatenated to the end. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10', 's' has been concatenated with '1' repeated 'b' times and '0' repeated 'a' times.
Output State: **'a', 'b' are integers between 0 and 100, 'x' is an integer between 1 and 'a' + 'b' - 1, 's' is either '0', '1' or '10', 's' has been concatenated with '1' repeated 'b' times and '0' repeated 'a' times**
