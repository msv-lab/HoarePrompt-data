Functionality: **The function takes three integers a, b, and x as input, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ x < a + b. It then performs a series of operations based on the values of a, b, and x, and constructs a string 's' accordingly. The constructed string 's' is then printed as the output. The function handles different cases based on the conditions specified in the code.**
