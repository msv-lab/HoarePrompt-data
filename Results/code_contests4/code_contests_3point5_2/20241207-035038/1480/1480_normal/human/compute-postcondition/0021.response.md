Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is decremented by 1. Since `a` is between 1 and 100, after execution, `a` will be between 0 and 99. The values of `b`, `x`, and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '10'.
Output State: **`a` is between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 1 and 100, `x` is an integer between 1 and `a` + `b` - 1, `s` is either '0' or '10'**
