Correctness: **True**

The program correctly constructs a binary string `s` of length `n = a + b` such that there are exactly `a` zeroes, exactly `b` ones, and exactly `x` indices `i` such that `s_i â‰  s_{i + 1}`. The program first checks if `x > 1` and `a == 1`, in which case it initializes `s` to '1' and decrements `b`, otherwise it initializes `s` to '0' and decrements `a`. Then, it enters a loop where it alternates between appending '0' and '1' to `s` based on the last character until `x` is greater than 1. Finally, it appends '1' repeated `b` times followed by '0' repeated `a` times if the last character of `s` is '0', and vice versa.

The program ensures that the output string `s` satisfies the given conditions for any valid input values of `a`, `b`, and `x`.
