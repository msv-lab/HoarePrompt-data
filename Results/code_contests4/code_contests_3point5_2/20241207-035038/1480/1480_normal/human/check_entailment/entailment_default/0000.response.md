Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes three integers a, b, and x as input and constructs a binary string 's' of length n = a + b such that there are exactly a zeroes, exactly b ones, and exactly x indices i such that s_i â‰  s_{i + 1).
- The code handles different cases based on the conditions specified in the problem description.
- It ensures that the constructed string 's' satisfies all the given conditions.
- The code guarantees that the answer always exists, which is in line with the problem description.
- There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle.
- Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
