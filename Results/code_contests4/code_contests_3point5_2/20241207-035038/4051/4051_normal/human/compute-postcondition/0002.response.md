The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers 'arr' obtained from the input values mapped and split by spaces. The constraints for the input integers n and k are such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^14. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to return a list of integers 'arr' obtained from the input values.
