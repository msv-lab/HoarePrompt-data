Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program provided only contains a function `func_1` that reads input values and returns a list of integers. However, it does not actually solve the problem described in the problem description. The program should include logic to calculate the number of ways Tanechka can choose two toys in such a way that their total cost is k burles. Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
