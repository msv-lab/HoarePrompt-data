Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases. The code only considers two scenarios: if n is greater than or equal to k and if n is less than k. However, it does not account for the case when k is less than n but still can be formed by choosing two toys. For example, if n=8 and k=5, the code should output 2 since the pair of toys (1, 4) or the pair of toys (2, 3) can be chosen. But the code does not handle this case correctly. This inconsistency makes the code incorrect.
