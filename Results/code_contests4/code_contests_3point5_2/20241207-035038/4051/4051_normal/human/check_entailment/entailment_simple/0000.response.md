Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not solve the problem described in the problem description. The function `func_1` only reads a list of integers from the input, but it does not actually calculate the number of ways Tanechka can choose two toys with the total cost of k burles.

To solve the problem, the program should iterate through all possible pairs of toys and check if their total cost is k. This involves calculating the total cost for each pair and counting the number of valid pairs.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect as it does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
