#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^14.**
def func_1():
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))
    return arr
    #The program returns the list of integers 'arr' obtained from the input values mapped and split by space
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values, splits them by spaces, maps them to integers, and returns a list of integers 'arr'. The function does not accept any parameters. The constraint for the input integers n and k is specified as 1 <= n, k <= 10^14.
