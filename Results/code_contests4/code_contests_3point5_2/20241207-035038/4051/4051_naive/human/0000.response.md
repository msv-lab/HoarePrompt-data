Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program does not handle all potential cases and may produce incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

For example, if we take the input:
```
7 20
```
The expected output should be 0, as choosing any pair of toys would lead to a total cost less than 20. However, the program provided would output 4 in this case, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
