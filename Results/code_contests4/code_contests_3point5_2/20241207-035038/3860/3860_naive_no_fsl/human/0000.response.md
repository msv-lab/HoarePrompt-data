Correctness: **True**

The provided problem description outlines a simple algorithm to determine which days road works will be in progress based on the intersections provided in the input. The program needs to correctly identify the days when at least one road will be asphalted.

Given the simplicity of the problem and the straightforward nature of the algorithm, there are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program might fail to produce the correct output. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided algorithm, the program is correct in determining the days when road works will be in progress.
