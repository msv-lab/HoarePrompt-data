Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by iterating through the schedule of intersections and determining if the roads should be asphalted based on whether they have been asphalted before or not. The output displays the days when road works will be in progress in ascending order, which aligns with the requirements of the problem. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the program does not handle.
