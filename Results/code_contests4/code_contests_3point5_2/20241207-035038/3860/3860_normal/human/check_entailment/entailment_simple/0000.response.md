Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it defines a function without any implementation inside it. Since the problem description does not specify any specific logic or operations to be performed inside the function, the empty function definition is sufficient to meet the requirements of the problem. The function can be used as a placeholder to potentially add the necessary logic in the future.
