Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input of the number of vertical and horizontal roads in the city and the order of intersections in the schedule. Then, it iterates through each intersection in the schedule and checks if both roads have been asphalted. If not, it prints the day number. This logic aligns with the problem description, where the team of workers asphalt both roads if none of the two roads that form the intersection were already asphalted. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
