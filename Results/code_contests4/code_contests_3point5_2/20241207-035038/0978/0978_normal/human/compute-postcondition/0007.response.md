The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`. The parameter `x4` can be either a list or a string. 

In Case 1, the program returns the result of calling func_2 with the argument being a list containing the result of calling func_1 with x4[0] and x4[1] concatenated with the elements of x4 starting from index 2.

In Case 2, the program returns the result of calling func_1 with the first and second characters of string x4.

In Case 3, the program returns the first character of the string `x4`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a parameter `x4`, which can be either a list or a string, and based on the different cases defined, it returns specific values derived from `x4` either by calling another function or manipulating the input.
