The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 500. 

Case 1: If x is greater than or equal to y and x is divisible by y, the function returns the value of y.

Case 2: If x is not larger than y and x is not divisible by y, the function returns the result of calling function func_1 with arguments y and the remainder of x divided by y.

Case 3: If x is a positive integer not larger than y and y is divisible by x, the function returns the value of x.

Case 4: If x is not larger than y and y is not divisible by x, the function returns the result of calling function func_1 with arguments x and y % x.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers x and y within the specified range, and return different values based on the conditions mentioned in the cases provided.
