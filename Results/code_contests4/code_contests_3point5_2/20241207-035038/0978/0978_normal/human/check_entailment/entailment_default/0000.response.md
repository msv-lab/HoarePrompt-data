# Your task:

Problem description: There is a grid of square cells with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. The cell at the i-th row and the j-th column will be denoted as Cell (i, j).

In Cell (i, j), a_{ij} coins are placed.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Operation: Choose a cell that was not chosen before and contains one or more coins, then move one of those coins to a vertically or horizontally adjacent cell.

Maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq H, W \leq 500
* 0 \leq a_{ij} \leq 9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1W}
a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2W}
:
a_{H1} a_{H2} ... a_{HW}


Output

Print a sequence of operations that maximizes the number of cells containing an even number of coins, in the following format:


N
y_1 x_1 y_1' x_1'
y_2 x_2 y_2' x_2'
:
y_N x_N y_N' x_N'


That is, in the first line, print an integer N between 0 and H \times W (inclusive), representing the number of operations.

In the (i+1)-th line (1 \leq i \leq N), print four integers y_i, x_i, y_i' and x_i' (1 \leq y_i, y_i' \leq H and 1 \leq x_i, x_i' \leq W), representing the i-th operation. These four integers represents the operation of moving one of the coins placed in Cell (y_i, x_i) to a vertically or horizontally adjacent cell, (y_i', x_i').

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(x, y):
    if x >= y:
        if x % y == 0:
            return y
        else:
            return func_1(y, x % y)
    elif y % x == 0:
        return x
    else:
        return func_1(x, y % x)
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are within the range of 1 to 500. The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case 1: If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the value of `y`.
- Case 2: If `x` is not larger than `y` and `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function recursively calls itself with arguments `y` and the remainder of `x` divided by `y`.
- Case 3: If `x` is a positive integer not larger than `y` and `y` is divisible by `x`, the function returns the value of `x`.
- Case 4: If `x` is not larger than `y` and `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function recursively calls itself with arguments `x` and `y % x`.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to handle different cases based on the relationship between the input integers `x` and `y`, providing specific return values accordingly.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x4):
    if len(x4) > 2:
        return func_2([func_1(x4[0], x4[1])] + x4[2:])
    elif len(x4) == 2:
        return func_1(x4[0], x4[1])
    else:
        return x4[0]
(N, X) = map(int, input().split())
x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
x.append(X)
x3 = []
for i in range(len(x) - 1):
    x3.append(abs(x[i + 1] - x[i]))
print(func_2(x3))
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x4`, which can be either a list or a string. 
If the length of `x4` is greater than 2, it returns the result of calling `func_2` with the argument being a list containing the result of calling `func_1` with the first two elements of `x4` concatenated with the remaining elements of `x4`.
If the length of `x4` is exactly 2, it returns the result of calling `func_1` with the first and second characters of the string `x4`.
If the length of `x4` is less than 2, it returns the first character of the string `x4`.
Therefore, it seems like the annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function.

Now, let's analyze the given code and determine if it meets the problem description and constraints.

Based on the code and the description, the functions provided do not seem to be directly related to the problem of moving coins in a grid to maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins. Therefore, the given code does not align with the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
