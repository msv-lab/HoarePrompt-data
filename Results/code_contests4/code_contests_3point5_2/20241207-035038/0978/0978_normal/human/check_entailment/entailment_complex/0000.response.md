Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not align with the problem description. The code consists of two recursive functions, func_1 and func_2, that operate on lists of integers. These functions deal with finding the greatest common divisor of two integers and performing operations on lists, which are not related to the problem description of moving coins to maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins in a grid.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
