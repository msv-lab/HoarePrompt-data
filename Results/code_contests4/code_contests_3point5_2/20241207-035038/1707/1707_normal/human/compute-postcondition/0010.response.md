Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `s`, `a`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 0**
