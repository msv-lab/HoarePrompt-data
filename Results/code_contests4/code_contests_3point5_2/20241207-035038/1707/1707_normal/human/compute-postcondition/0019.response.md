According to the code, the loop executes for `n` times starting from 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n-1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n`**
