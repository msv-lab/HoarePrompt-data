According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n + 1` for the loop to execute the next time**.
