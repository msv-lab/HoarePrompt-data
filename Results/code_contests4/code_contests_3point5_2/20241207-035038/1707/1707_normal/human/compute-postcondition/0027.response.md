According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times for the given range. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n + 1`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is `n + 2`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+2]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n + 2`**
