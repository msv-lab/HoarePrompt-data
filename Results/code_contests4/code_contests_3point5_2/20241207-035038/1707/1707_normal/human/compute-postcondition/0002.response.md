Example Answer:
A new list `a` is created where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are integers converted from strings in list `s`. The length of list `a` will be `n+1`. The values of list `s` are used to populate list `a` as integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers**
