According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated with the maximum value between the current `ans` and 0, `j` is 2**
