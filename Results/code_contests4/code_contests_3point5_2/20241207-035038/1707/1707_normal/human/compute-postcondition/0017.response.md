Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and the result of XOR operation between the elements at index `i` and `j` of list `a`. The current value of `ans` is compared with the XOR result and updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated with the maximum value between the current `ans` and 0, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated with the maximum value between the current `ans` and 0, `j` is 2**
