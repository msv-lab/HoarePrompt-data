Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The function `raw_input()` reads a line from input and converts it to a string, then `int()` converts that string to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, the value of `n` after execution will be the positive integer entered by the user.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer**
