Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the result of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and `a[n+2]`. The value of `i` is updated to `n + 1`, and the value of `j` is updated to `n + 2` for the next iteration. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the updated maximum value of XOR operation, `j` is `n + 2`**
