According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, and it must still be less than `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated with the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of XOR operation between `a[i]` and `a[j]`, `j` is 1**
