According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the loop will execute `n + 1` times. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers with updated values after XOR operations for all elements of the list, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
