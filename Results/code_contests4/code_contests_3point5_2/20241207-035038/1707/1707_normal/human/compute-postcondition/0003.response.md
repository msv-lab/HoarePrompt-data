According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Based on the loop statement `for i in range(1, n + 1)`, the loop will iterate from 1 to n (inclusive). Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
