According to the code, the loop can execute depending on the variables `j`, `i`, and the length of list `s`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n + 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `i`. Therefore, the next state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of XOR operation between `a[n+1]` and all previous elements in the list, `j` is `n + 2` for the loop to execute the next time**
