Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximal xor of a segment of consecutive elements in the given array as described in the problem description. It first calculates the xor of all elements up to each index in the array and stores it in the list `a`. Then, it iterates through all possible pairs of indices and calculates the xor value between them to find the maximum xor of a segment.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and will output the correct result for any input array.
