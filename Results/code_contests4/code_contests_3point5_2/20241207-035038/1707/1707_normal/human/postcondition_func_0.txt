The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the user, reads a list of strings `s`, converts them to integers, performs XOR operations on the elements of the list `a`, and then finds the maximum XOR value between elements of `a`. The function does not accept any parameters and prints the maximum XOR value as output.
