Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program implements the four functions as described in the problem statement. 
1. `func_1`: Adds edges to the graph and reverse graph.
2. `func_2`: Performs a DFS traversal to fill the `back_track` list.
3. `func_3`: Fills the `cmp` array with the strongly connected components.
4. `func_4`: Computes the number of strongly connected components and the component array.

After processing the input graph, the program handles queries by checking if the components of the given nodes are the same. It prints "1" if they belong to the same component and "0" otherwise.

The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description, such as building the graph, computing strongly connected components, and answering queries about whether two nodes belong to the same component. Since the code implements the logic as described in the problem statement and there are no missing edge cases mentioned, the correctness of the program is considered True.
