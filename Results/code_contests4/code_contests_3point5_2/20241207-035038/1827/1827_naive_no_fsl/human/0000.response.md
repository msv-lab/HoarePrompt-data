Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the directed graph and queries.
2. It then constructs the graph and its reverse graph using the provided functions.
3. The program then performs a depth-first search to identify strongly connected components in the graph.
4. Finally, it processes each query and checks if the two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, printing the result accordingly.
5. The logic for identifying strongly connected components and checking if two nodes belong to the same component appears to be correct based on the provided code.
6. The program covers the constraints mentioned in the problem description.
