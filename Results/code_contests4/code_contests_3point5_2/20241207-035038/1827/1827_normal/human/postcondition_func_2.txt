The function `func_3` accepts parameters `now`, `num_cmp`, `used`, and `cmp`. It marks all nodes reachable from the current node `now` as visited in the `used` array, assigns the value of `num_cmp` to the corresponding nodes in the `cmp` array, and ensures that each visited node has at least one connection in the graph. The function does not explicitly return a value.
