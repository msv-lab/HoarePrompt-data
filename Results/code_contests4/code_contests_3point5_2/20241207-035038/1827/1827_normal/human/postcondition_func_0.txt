The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `frm` and `to`, both integers representing nodes in a directed graph. It modifies the graph structure by appending the `to` node to the adjacency list of `frm` in the directed graph `g` and vice versa in the reverse directed graph `rg`. There is no specific return value mentioned in the provided information.
