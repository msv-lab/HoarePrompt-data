You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.
