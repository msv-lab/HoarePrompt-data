Example Answer:
All elements in the `cmp` list are assigned the value `-1` n times. Since the initial state mentions that `used` list elements are `False` and `back_track` is an empty list, and they are not affected by this code, the Output State is: All elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, and all elements in the `cmp` list are `-1`.
Output State: **All elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, and all elements in the `cmp` list are `-1`**
