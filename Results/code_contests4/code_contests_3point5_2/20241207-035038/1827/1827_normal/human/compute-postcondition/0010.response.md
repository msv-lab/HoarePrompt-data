According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v` and `n`. If `v` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains `v`, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is 1. Since the loop is iterating over `v`, for the next iteration, `v` will be updated to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `v` should be less than `n`, i.e., `v` should be less than the maximum value of `n`. 
State: **All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains 2, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
