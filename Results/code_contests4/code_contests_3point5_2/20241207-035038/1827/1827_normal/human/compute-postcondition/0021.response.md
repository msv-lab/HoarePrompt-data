According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements remaining in the `back_track` list. At the end of the last iteration, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, and the loop is currently iterating in reverse order. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `back_track` needs to be considered.

State: **All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, the value of `v` in `used` is `True`, and the value of `v` in `cmp` is set to `num_cmp`, for the loop to execute one more time the next element in `back_track` needs to be considered.**
