Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes. It initializes three lists `used`, `back_track`, and `cmp` with specific values. Then, it iterates through the elements of `back_track` to update `used` and `cmp` accordingly. Finally, it returns the total number of elements in `back_track`, stored in `num_cmp`, and the list `cmp` containing values ranging from 0 to n-1 in order. The function does not include the implementation details of `func_2` and `func_3`, so it relies on those functions to update the necessary lists.**
