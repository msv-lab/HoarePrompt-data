Example Answer: 
All elements in the `used` list are now set to `False` instead of `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **All elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
