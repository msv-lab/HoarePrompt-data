The function `func_4` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes. The function returns two values: the total number of elements in `back_track`, which is stored in `num_cmp`, and the list `cmp` containing values ranging from 0 to n-1 in order. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_4 is to accept a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes and return the total number of elements in `back_track` and a list `cmp` containing values from 0 to n-1 in order.
