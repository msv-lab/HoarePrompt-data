According to the code, the loop can execute again if `v` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` needs to be incremented by 1, so `v` will be 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains `v`, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is 1, and the function `func_2(v, used, back_track)` is executed with the values of `used` and `back_track` updated accordingly for the next iteration.**
