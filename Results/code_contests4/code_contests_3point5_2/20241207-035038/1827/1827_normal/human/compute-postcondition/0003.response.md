According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, all elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, and all elements in the `cmp` list are `-1`. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `v` is 0.
State: **All elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` is an empty list, all elements in the `cmp` list are `-1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is 0**
