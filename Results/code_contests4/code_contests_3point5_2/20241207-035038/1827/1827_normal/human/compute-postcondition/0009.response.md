Postcondition: ***All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains `v`, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `v` is 1. The function `func_2(v, used, back_track)` has been executed with the values of `used` and `back_track` updated accordingly for the next iteration.***
