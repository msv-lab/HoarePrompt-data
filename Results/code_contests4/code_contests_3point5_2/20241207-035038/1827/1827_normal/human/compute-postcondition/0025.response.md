According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `back_track` list. If there are more elements to consider, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, the value of `v` in `used` is `True`, the value of `v` in `cmp` is set to `num_cmp`, and the loop will consider the next element in `back_track` for execution. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the `back_track` list needs to be considered.
State: **All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_cmp` is incremented by 1, the value of `v` in `used` is `True`, the value of `v` in `cmp` is set to `num_cmp`, and the loop will consider the next element in `back_track` for execution, for the loop to execute one more time the next element in `back_track` needs to be considered.**
