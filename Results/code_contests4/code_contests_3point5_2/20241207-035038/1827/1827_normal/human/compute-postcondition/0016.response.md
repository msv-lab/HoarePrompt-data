According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `back_track` is not empty. In this case, `back_track` is a list containing values from 0 to n-1 in order, so the loop will execute if n is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `used` list should have all elements as `False`, `cmp` list should have all elements as `-1`, `num_cmp` should be 0, and `v` should be the last element in the `back_track` list.

State: **All elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_cmp` is 0, `v` is the last element in `back_track` list, for the loop to execute**
