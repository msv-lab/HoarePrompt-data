Postcondition: ***All elements in the `used` list are `False`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_cmp` is 0, `v` is the last element in `back_track` list, and the value of `v` in `used` is `False`, for the loop to execute.***
