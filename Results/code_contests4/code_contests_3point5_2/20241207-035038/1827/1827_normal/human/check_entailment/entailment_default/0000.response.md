After analyzing the given code and the problem description, along with the output hints, I have come to the following conclusion:

The code seems to correctly implement the logic required to determine if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph. The functions provided in the code appropriately handle the traversal and identification of components in the graph.

The `func_1` function initializes the directed graph by appending the target node to the adjacency list of the source node and vice versa in the reverse directed graph.

The `func_2` function performs a depth-first search traversal of the graph, marking visited nodes and adding them to the back_track list.

The `func_3` function marks nodes reachable from a given node and assigns them to a specific component.

The `func_4` function utilizes the above functions to identify the strongly connected components in the graph and then processes the queries to determine if two nodes belong to the same component.

Based on the code implementation and the provided problem description, as well as the output hints, I couldn't find any edge cases or scenarios where the code does not adhere to the problem requirements. The functions seem to correctly identify whether two nodes are part of the same strongly connected component in the directed graph.

Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **True**.
