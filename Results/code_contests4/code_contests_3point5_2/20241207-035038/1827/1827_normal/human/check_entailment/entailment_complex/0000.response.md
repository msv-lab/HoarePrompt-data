Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code defines functions to handle the creation of a directed graph, traversal of the graph to find strongly connected components, and processing queries to determine if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component.
2. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are designed to handle the graph operations efficiently.
3. The `func_4` function correctly initializes the necessary data structures, performs depth-first search to find strongly connected components, and returns the required information for processing queries.
4. The code structure aligns with the problem description by ensuring that every two nodes are mutually reachable within a strongly connected component.
5. The provided example input and output demonstrate that the code can correctly identify if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component.
6. Based on the annotations and the code logic, there are no apparent cases where the code deviates from the problem description.
