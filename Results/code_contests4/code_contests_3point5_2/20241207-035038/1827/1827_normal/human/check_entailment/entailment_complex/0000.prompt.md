You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a directed graph G(V, E) where |V| is the number of nodes, |E| is the number of edges, and each query contains a pair of nodes u and v. The nodes are named with numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1. The nodes u and v in each query are integers representing nodes in the graph.**
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `frm` and `to`, both integers representing nodes in a directed graph. It modifies the graph structure by appending the `to` node to the adjacency list of `frm` in the directed graph `g` and vice versa in the reverse directed graph `rg`. There is no specific return value mentioned in the provided information.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: |V| is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, |E| is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries. Each si and ti are integers representing the source and target nodes of the i-th edge, and each ui and vi are pairs of integers representing nodes in the graph.**
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: |V|, |E|, Q, si, ti, ui, vi are integers. Each si and ti are integers, each ui and vi are pairs of integers. used at index now is True. The loop will continue to execute as long as g[now] returns a non-empty list of nodes, and (not used[nx]) is True for each node nx in the list returned by g[now].
    back_track.append(now)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 recursively traverses a graph starting from a given node `now` and marks the nodes visited by setting them to True in the `used` array. It appends the visited nodes to the `back_track` list. The function does not have a return value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: V is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, E is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges in the graph, Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries. si and ti are integers representing the source and target nodes of the i-th edge, where 0 <= si, ti < V. ui and vi are integers representing a pair of nodes given as the i-th query, where 0 <= ui, vi < V.**
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: V, E, Q, si, ti, ui, vi, num_cmp, cmp, used are all integers and arrays as described. After the execution of the if-else block, all nodes reachable from the initial node 'now' are marked as visited in the used array, cmp contains the values of num_cmp for each visited node, and there is at least one node connected to each visited node in rg.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts parameters `now`, `num_cmp`, `used`, and `cmp`. It marks all nodes reachable from the current node `now` as visited in the `used` array, assigns the value of `num_cmp` to the corresponding nodes in the `cmp` array, and ensures that each visited node has at least one connection in the graph. The function does not explicitly return a value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: V is a positive integer representing the number of nodes, E is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges, Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries. Each query pair (u, v) consists of two integers u and v such that 0 <= u, v < V.**
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list will have values ranging from 0 to n-1 in order, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_cmp` is equal to the total number of elements in `back_track`, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `back_track` updating the corresponding values in `used` and `cmp`.
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the total number of elements in `back_track`, which is stored in `num_cmp`, and the list `cmp` containing values ranging from 0 to n-1 in order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes. It initializes three lists `used`, `back_track`, and `cmp` with specific values. Then, it iterates through the elements of `back_track` to update `used` and `cmp` accordingly. Finally, it returns the total number of elements in `back_track`, stored in `num_cmp`, and the list `cmp` containing values ranging from 0 to n-1 in order. The function does not include the implementation details of `func_2` and `func_3`, so it relies on those functions to update the necessary lists.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
