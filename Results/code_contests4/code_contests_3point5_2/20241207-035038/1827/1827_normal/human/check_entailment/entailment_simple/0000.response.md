Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of four functions that correctly implement the algorithm for determining if two nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph. The functions correctly traverse the graph to identify strongly connected components and assign component numbers to nodes within the same component.

Function 1 correctly constructs the directed graph by adding edges from source nodes to target nodes and vice versa.

Function 2 correctly performs a depth-first search traversal of the graph to create a backtracking list of nodes based on their finishing times.

Function 3 correctly assigns component numbers to nodes by performing a depth-first search traversal on the reversed graph, ensuring that all nodes in the same strongly connected component have the same component number.

Function 4 correctly utilizes functions 2 and 3 to determine the number of strongly connected components in the graph and assigns component numbers to all nodes.

Overall, the program follows the problem description by correctly identifying if two given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component in a directed graph.
