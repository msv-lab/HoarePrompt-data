You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A direced graph is strongly connected if every two nodes are reachable from each other. In a strongly connected component of a directed graph, every two nodes of the component are mutually reachable.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ |V| ≤ 10,000
* 0 ≤ |E| ≤ 30,000
* 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000

Input

A directed graph G(V, E) and a sequence of queries where each query contains a pair of nodes u and v.


|V| |E|
s0 t0
s1 t1
:
s|E|-1 t|E|-1
Q
u0 v0
u1 v1
:
uQ-1 vQ-1


|V| is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The graph nodes are named with the numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1 respectively.

si and ti represent source and target nodes of i-th edge (directed).

ui and vi represent a pair of nodes given as the i-th query.

Output

For each query, pinrt "1" if the given nodes belong to the same strongly connected component, "0" otherwise.

Example

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a directed graph G(V, E) where |V| is the number of nodes, |E| is the number of edges, and each query contains a pair of nodes u and v. The nodes are named with numbers 0, 1,..., |V|-1. The nodes u and v in each query are integers representing nodes in the graph.**
def func_1(frm, to):
    g[frm].append(to)
    rg[to].append(frm)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: |V| is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, |E| is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges in the graph, and Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries. Each si and ti are integers representing the source and target nodes of the i-th edge, and each ui and vi are pairs of integers representing nodes in the graph.**
def func_2(now, used, back_track):
    used[now] = True
    for nx in g[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_2(nx, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: |V|, |E|, Q, si, ti, ui, vi are integers. Each si and ti are integers, each ui and vi are pairs of integers. used at index now is True. The loop will continue to execute as long as g[now] returns a non-empty list of nodes, and (not used[nx]) is True for each node nx in the list returned by g[now].
    back_track.append(now)

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: V is a non-negative integer representing the number of nodes in the graph, E is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges in the graph, Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries. si and ti are integers representing the source and target nodes of the i-th edge, where 0 <= si, ti < V. ui and vi are integers representing a pair of nodes given as the i-th query, where 0 <= ui, vi < V.**
def func_3(now, num_cmp, used, cmp):
    used[now] = True
    cmp[now] = num_cmp
    for nx in rg[now]:
        if not used[nx]:
            func_3(nx, num_cmp, used, cmp)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: V, E, Q, si, ti, ui, vi, num_cmp, cmp, used are all integers and arrays as described. After the execution of the if-else block, all nodes reachable from the initial node 'now' are marked as visited in the used array, cmp contains the values of num_cmp for each visited node, and there is at least one node connected to each visited node in rg.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: V is a positive integer representing the number of nodes, E is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges, Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries. Each query pair (u, v) consists of two integers u and v such that 0 <= u, v < V.**
def func_4(n):
    used = [False] * n
    back_track = []
    cmp = [-1] * n
    for v in xrange(n):
        if not used[v]:
            func_2(v, used, back_track)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list remain `-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
    used = [False] * n
    num_cmp = 0
    for v in back_track[::-1]:
        if not used[v]:
            func_3(v, num_cmp, used, cmp)
            num_cmp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in the `used` list are `True`, `back_track` contains all values from 0 to n-1 in order, all elements in the `cmp` list will have values ranging from 0 to n-1 in order, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `num_cmp` is equal to the total number of elements in `back_track`, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `back_track` updating the corresponding values in `used` and `cmp`.
    return num_cmp, cmp
    #The program returns the total number of elements in `back_track`, which is stored in `num_cmp`, and the list `cmp` containing values ranging from 0 to n-1 in order


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
