Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not implement the logic required to find the number of cyclic permutations of length n as described in the problem description. The functions defined in the program do not compute the desired output based on the input n. Instead, they focus on basic input processing functions like reading integers and splitting strings.

To determine the number of cyclic permutations of length n, the program should involve a more complex algorithm that considers the permutation of length n, builds a graph based on the permutation, and then determines the number of cyclic permutations by analyzing the cycles in the graph. The annotated program falls short in this regard as it lacks the necessary logic for this computation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description.
