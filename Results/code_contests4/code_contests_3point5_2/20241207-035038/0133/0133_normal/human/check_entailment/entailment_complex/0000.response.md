Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. One of the functions, `func_6`, calculates the prime factors of a given integer `n`, which is not directly related to the problem of finding cyclic permutations. There is no indication in the problem description that prime factorization is required for solving the main problem.

Therefore, the inclusion of `func_6` in the code violates the problem description as it introduces unnecessary logic that is not relevant to the main task. This deviation from the problem description makes the code incorrect.
