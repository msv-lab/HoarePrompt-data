#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user through input(). The integer value 'n' is such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 prompts the user to enter an integer value and returns it. The function ensures that the returned integer value 'n' satisfies the condition 3 <= n <= 10^6.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. The input string is assumed to be split based on spaces and converted to integers. The function does not handle cases where the input string does not contain valid integers or cases where the input format is different from space-separated integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.**
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing all characters of the input string 's' except for the last character. The integer 'n' is such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input string 's' and returns a list containing all characters of 's' except for the last character. The function does not consider the integer 'n' mentioned in the annotation, and it does not restrict the input length within the range specified.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input. However, it is important to note that the code snippet lacks error handling or validation for the input, so it might raise exceptions if the input is not in the expected format or if there are issues during the conversion to integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.**
def func_5():
    s = input()
    return s.split(' ')
    #The program returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string 's' at each occurrence of a space character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of substrings obtained by splitting the user input string 's' at each occurrence of a space character. It is assumed that the input string 's' is not specifically mentioned in the annotations but inferred as user input.

    return ans
    #The program returns the list 'ans' containing the prime factors of the initial value of 'n'. If 'n' is greater than 1, 'n' is appended to the list 'ans'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts an integer `n` between 3 and 10^6. It calculates the prime factors of `n` and stores them in a list 'ans'. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns a list 'ans' containing the prime factors of `n`, with `n` appended to the list if it is greater than 1.

        return div
        #The program returns the result of the floor division of the factorial of 'n' by the product of 'b' and the factorial of 'n-k'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. It then checks for three possible cases:
Case_1: If `n` is equal to 1 or `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns 1.
Case_2: If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0.
Case_3: For all other cases, the function calculates the factorial of `n`, `k`, and `n-k`, and returns the floor division of the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorials of `k` and `n-k`.
