You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Consider a permutation p of length n, we build a graph of size n using it as follows: 

  * For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, find the largest j such that 1 ≤ j < i and p_j > p_i, and add an undirected edge between node i and node j 
  * For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, find the smallest j such that i < j ≤ n and p_j > p_i, and add an undirected edge between node i and node j 



In cases where no such j exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.

For clarity, consider as an example n = 4, and p = [3,1,4,2]; here, the edges of the graph are (1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3).

A permutation p is cyclic if the graph built using p has at least one simple cycle. 

Given n, find the number of cyclic permutations of length n. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.

Please refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle

Input

The first and only line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

Output

Output a single integer 0 ≤ x < 10^9+7, the number of cyclic permutations of length n modulo 10^9+7.

Note

There are 16 cyclic permutations for n = 4. [4,2,1,3] is one such permutation, having a cycle of length four: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 4.

Nodes v_1, v_2, …, v_k form a simple cycle if the following conditions hold: 

  * k ≥ 3. 
  * v_i ≠ v_j for any pair of indices i and j. (1 ≤ i < j ≤ k) 
  * v_i and v_{i+1} share an edge for all i (1 ≤ i < k), and v_1 and v_k share an edge.

def func_7(n, k):
```
