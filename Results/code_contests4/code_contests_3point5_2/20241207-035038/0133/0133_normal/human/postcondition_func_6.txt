The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. It then checks for three possible cases:
Case_1: If `n` is equal to 1 or `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns 1.
Case_2: If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0.
Case_3: For all other cases, the function calculates the factorial of `n`, `k`, and `n-k`, and returns the floor division of the factorial of `n` by the product of the factorials of `k` and `n-k`.
