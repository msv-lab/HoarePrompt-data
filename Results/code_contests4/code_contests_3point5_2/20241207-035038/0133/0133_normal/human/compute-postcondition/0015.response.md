Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `ans`. The list `ans` will now contain the value of `i` in addition to any previous values. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, n is not equal to 1, `i` and `cap` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute again, `ans` contains the appended values of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, n is not equal to 1, `i` and `cap` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute again, `ans` contains the appended values of `i`**
