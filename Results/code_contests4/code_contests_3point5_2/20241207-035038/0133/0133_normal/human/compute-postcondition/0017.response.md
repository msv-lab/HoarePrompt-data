Example Answer:
`cap` is assigned the square root of `n`. The value of `n` is unknown, so the exact value of `cap` cannot be determined. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to the integer division of itself by `i`, `i` and `cap` are adjusted based on conditions, `ans` contains the appended values of `i`, `cap` is the square root of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is updated to the integer division of itself by `i`, `i` and `cap` are adjusted based on conditions, `ans` contains the appended values of `i`, `cap` is the square root of `n`**
