The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. After executing the function body, there are two possible cases:

Case 1: The program returns a list containing the integer 1.

Case 2: The program returns a list 'ans' containing the prime factors of the initial value of 'n'. If 'n' is greater than 1, 'n' is appended to the list 'ans'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `n`, and based on the value of 'n', it either returns a list containing the integer 1 or a list containing the prime factors of 'n' with 'n' appended if it is greater than 1.
