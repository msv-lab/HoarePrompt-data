The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6. After executing the function body, there are three possible cases for the return value:

Case_1: The program returns 1.
Case_2: The program returns 0.
Case_3: The program returns the result of the floor division of the factorial of 'n' by the product of 'b' and the factorial of 'n-k'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_7 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return 1, 0, or the result of the floor division of the factorial of 'n' by the product of 'b' and the factorial of 'n-k' based on the cases mentioned above.
