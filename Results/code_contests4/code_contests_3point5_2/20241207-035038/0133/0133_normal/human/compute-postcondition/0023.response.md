Example Answer:
The value of `cap` is assigned the square root of `n`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `n`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `cap`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated based on `n` integer divided by `i`, `i`, `cap` is the square root of `n`, `ans` remain integers as before.
Output State: **`n` is updated based on `n` integer divided by `i`, `i`, `cap` is the square root of `n`, `ans` remain integers as before**
