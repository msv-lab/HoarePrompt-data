Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `n` integer divided by `i`. The value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot calculate the exact result. The variables `cap` and `ans` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is updated based on `n` integer divided by `i`, `i`, `cap`, and `ans` remain integers as before**
