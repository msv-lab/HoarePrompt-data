Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `math.factorial(k)`, where `k` is a new variable introduced in this code snippet and `math.factorial()` calculates the factorial of a number. Since there is no information provided about the value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the factorial of `n`.
Output State: **`a` is the factorial of `n`**
