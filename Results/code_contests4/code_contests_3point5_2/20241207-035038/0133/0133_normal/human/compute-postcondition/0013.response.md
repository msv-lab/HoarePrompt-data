Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, n is not equal to 1. If n % i == 0, n is updated to a new value, ans contains values of i that divide n, and cap is the square root of n. If n is not divisible by i without any remainder, n remains the same, i is incremented by 1, and cap is the square root of n.***
