Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `ans`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `cap`, and `ans` are integers and for the loop to execute one more time, either `i` needs to be less than or equal to `cap` or `i` needs to be incremented and `cap` adjusted based on the conditions, `ans` contains the appended value of `i`.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `cap`, and `ans` are integers and for the loop to execute one more time, either `i` needs to be less than or equal to `cap` or `i` needs to be incremented and `cap` adjusted based on the conditions, `ans` contains the appended value of `i`**
