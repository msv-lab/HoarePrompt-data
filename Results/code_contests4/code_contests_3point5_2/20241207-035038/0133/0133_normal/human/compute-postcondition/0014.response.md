According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `cap`. If `i` is less than or equal to `cap`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` may or may not have been updated based on the condition `n % i == 0`. If `n` was updated, then `i` will contain values that divide `n`, and `cap` will be the square root of the new `n`. If `n` was not updated, then `i` will be incremented by 1, and `cap` will be the square root of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, n is not equal to 1, i and cap are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute again**
