Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again unless `i` reaches the value of `n`, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, n is not equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and `cap` is adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, n is not equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and `cap` is adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute again**
