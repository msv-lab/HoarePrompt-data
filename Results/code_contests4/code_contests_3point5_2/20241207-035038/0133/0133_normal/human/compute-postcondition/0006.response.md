Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of the factorial of `n` using the `math.factorial()` function. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^6 (excluding 1 and k), and k is less than or equal to n, the value of `a` is the factorial of `n`. 
Output State: **`a` is the factorial of `n`**
