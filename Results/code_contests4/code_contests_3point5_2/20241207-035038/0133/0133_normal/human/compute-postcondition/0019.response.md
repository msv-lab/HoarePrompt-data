Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `cap`, `ans` are integers. If `n % i == 0`, `n` is updated to the integer division of itself by `i`, `i` and `cap` are adjusted based on conditions, `ans` contains the appended values of `i`, `cap` is the square root of `n`. If `n % i != 0`, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, n is not equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `cap` is adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute again.***
