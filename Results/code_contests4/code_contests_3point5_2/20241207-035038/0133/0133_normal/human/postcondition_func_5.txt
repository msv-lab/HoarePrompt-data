The function `func_6` accepts an integer `n` between 3 and 10^6. It calculates the prime factors of `n` and stores them in a list 'ans'. If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing the integer 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns a list 'ans' containing the prime factors of `n`, with `n` appended to the list if it is greater than 1.
