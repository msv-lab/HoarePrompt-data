Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not calculate the number of cyclic permutations of length n as described in the problem statement. The calculation of `ans` in the program is not correct for finding the number of cyclic permutations. Additionally, the subtraction of `2 ** (n - 1)` is not a valid step in this context.

The correct approach to solving this problem involves the concept of cycle index polynomials and Mobius inversion. The program provided does not implement this approach and does not output the correct number of cyclic permutations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the problem description provided.
