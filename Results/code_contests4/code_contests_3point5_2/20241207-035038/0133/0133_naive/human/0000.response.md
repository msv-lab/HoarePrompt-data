Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of cyclic permutations of length n. The issue lies in the calculation of `ans` variable. The program calculates `ans` as the factorial of n and then subtracts 2 raised to the power of (n-1). This logic is incorrect for calculating the number of cyclic permutations.

A correct approach to calculate the number of cyclic permutations involves using the concept of cycle index polynomials. The correct formula to calculate the number of cyclic permutations of length n is:

ans = (n-1)! modulo (10^9 + 7)

Therefore, the given program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
