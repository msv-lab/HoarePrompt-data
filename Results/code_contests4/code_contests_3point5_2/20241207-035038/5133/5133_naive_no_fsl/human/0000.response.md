Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It is missing the step to compare the values of A+B, A-B, and A*B to find the largest value among them. Instead, it simply calculates all three values and finds the maximum among them.

For example, if the input is 1 5, the correct output should be 6 (A+B), but the program will output 5 (Max: 5) because it does not compare the values properly.
