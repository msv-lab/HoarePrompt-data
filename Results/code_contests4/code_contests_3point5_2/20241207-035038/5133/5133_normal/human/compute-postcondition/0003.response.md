Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of the difference between `a` and `b`. Since `a` is waiting for user input and `b` is an input integer, the value of `d` will depend on the user input for `a` and the specific value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer, `d` is the result of the subtraction operation between `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer, `d` is the result of the subtraction operation between `a` and `b**`.
