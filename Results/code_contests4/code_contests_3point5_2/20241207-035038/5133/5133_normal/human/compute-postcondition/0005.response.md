Example Answer:
`ary` is assigned a list containing `c`, `d`, and `e`. The variables `c`, `d`, and `e` are not defined in the initial state, so their values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer, `d` is the result of the subtraction operation between `a` and `b, `e` contains the result of the multiplication operation between `a` and `b, `ary` is a list with undefined values.
Output State: **`a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer, `d` is the result of the subtraction operation between `a` and `b, `e` contains the result of the multiplication operation between `a` and `b, `ary` is a list with undefined values**
