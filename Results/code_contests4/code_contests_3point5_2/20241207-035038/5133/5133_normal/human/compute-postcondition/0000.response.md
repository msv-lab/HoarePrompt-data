Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since there are no input variables provided, the program will wait for user input to assign a value to `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is waiting for user input.
Output State: **`a` is waiting for user input**
