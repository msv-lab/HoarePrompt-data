Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `a` is waiting for user input, and after this code snippet, `b` will hold the integer input value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer**
