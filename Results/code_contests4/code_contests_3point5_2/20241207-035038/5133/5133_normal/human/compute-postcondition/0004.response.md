Example Answer: 
`e` is assigned the value of the multiplication operation between `a` and `b`. The value of `a` is waiting for user input and the value of `b` is an input integer. Therefore, after execution, `e` will contain the result of the multiplication. The value of `d` is not affected. 
Output State: **`a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer, `d` is the result of the subtraction operation between `a` and `b, `e` contains the result of the multiplication operation between `a` and `b**
