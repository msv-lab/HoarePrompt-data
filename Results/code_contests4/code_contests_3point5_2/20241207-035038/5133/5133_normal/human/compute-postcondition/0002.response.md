Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `a` + `b`, where `a` is waiting for user input and `b` is an input integer. The value of `c` will depend on the actual values input by the user for `a` and `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is waiting for user input, `b` is an input integer**
