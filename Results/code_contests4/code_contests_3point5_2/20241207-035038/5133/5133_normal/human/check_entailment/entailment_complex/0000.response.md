Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func()` that takes two integers as input, calculates their sum, difference, and product, finds the maximum value among these results, and prints it as 'Max: f'. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, where the task is to find the largest value among A+B, A-B, and A*B for the given integers A and B. The program covers all possible cases and outputs the correct result accordingly.
