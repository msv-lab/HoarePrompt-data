Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the input is given in the format "A B" but the code is taking two separate inputs using `int(input())`. This means that the code is not correctly handling the input format specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output is not in the correct format as specified in the description. The code prints 'Max: f' instead of just the maximum value. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
