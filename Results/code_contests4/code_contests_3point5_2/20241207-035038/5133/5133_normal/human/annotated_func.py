#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are no input variables for this function.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = a + b
    d = a - b
    e = a * b
    ary = [c, d, e]
    f = max(ary)
    print('Max:', f)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func prompts the user to enter two integers, calculates their sum, difference, and product, then finds the maximum value among these results and prints it as 'Max: f'. The function does not accept any input parameters and does not return any output.
