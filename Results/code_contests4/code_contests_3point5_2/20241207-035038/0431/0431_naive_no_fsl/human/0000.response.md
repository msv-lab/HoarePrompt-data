Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all garbage for a given list of garbage produced on each day and bag's capacity.
2. The program correctly reads the input, calls the `func_1` function for the original list and the reversed list, and outputs the minimum number of bags needed.
3. The program follows the problem description by considering the number of units of garbage produced on each day and ensuring that no garbage is left after the last day by disposing of it either on the day it was produced or the next day.
4. The logic in the `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of bags needed by keeping track of any remaining garbage that can be added to the next bag.
5. The program handles the edge case where the last day's garbage needs an additional bag for disposal if there is any remaining garbage from the previous days.
6. The program works correctly for the provided examples and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
