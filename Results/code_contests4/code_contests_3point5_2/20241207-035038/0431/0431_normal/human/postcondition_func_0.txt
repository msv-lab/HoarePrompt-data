The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `k`. It iterates over the elements of `a`, calculating the total number of bags based on the division of each element by `k` and any remaining amount carried over to the next iteration. The function returns the total number of bags calculated after the loop. If there is a remaining `carry` after the loop, an additional bag is added.
