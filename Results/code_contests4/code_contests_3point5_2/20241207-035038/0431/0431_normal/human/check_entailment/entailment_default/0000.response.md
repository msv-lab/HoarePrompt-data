Based on the code and the problem description, the program seems to be correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `k`, as well as the list of integers `a`.
- The `func_1` function calculates the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all garbage for the given days by iterating over each element in `a`, considering the carry-over from the previous iteration, and adding an additional bag if there is a remaining carry.
- The `func_2` function calls `func_1` twice with different arguments derived from `a` and `k`, and prints the minimum result obtained from these calls.

There are no edge cases identified that the code might not be handling, and the output hints also align with the code functionality. Therefore, the program is correct.
