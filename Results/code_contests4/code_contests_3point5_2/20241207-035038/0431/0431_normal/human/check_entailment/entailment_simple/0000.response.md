Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of bags needed to dispose of all garbage produced over a given number of days, taking into account the bag's capacity. The program uses a greedy approach to minimize the number of bags required by distributing the garbage efficiently across days. The function `func_1` calculates the total number of bags needed based on the input list of garbage produced each day and the bag capacity. The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` twice (once with the original list and once with the reversed list), and prints the minimum result between the two calculations.

The program handles all potential cases and correctly calculates the minimum number of bags required to dispose of all garbage according to the problem description.
