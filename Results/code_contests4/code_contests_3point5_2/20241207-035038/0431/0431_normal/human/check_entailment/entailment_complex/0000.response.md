Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description by calculating the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage for the given n days. It considers the constraints of producing garbage on a daily basis, disposing of it either on the same day or the next day, and using bags with a maximum capacity. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this, with `func_2` handling the input and calling `func_1` to perform the necessary calculations. The provided annotations also align with the problem description and the actual code logic. Overall, the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
