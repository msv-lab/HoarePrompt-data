Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of n and k are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, `a` is a list of integers**
