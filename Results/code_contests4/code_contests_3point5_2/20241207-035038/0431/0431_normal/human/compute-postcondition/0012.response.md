Example Answer: 
`bags` is updated by adding the integer division result of `i` divided by `k`. The value of `carry` is the remainder of `i` divided by `k`. The iterator variable `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over. The value of `i` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above. Therefore, the Output State is: `bags` is updated by 1, `carry` is the remainder of `i` divided by `k`, `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over, `i` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **`bags` is updated by 1, `carry` is the remainder of `i` divided by `k`, `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over, `i` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above**
