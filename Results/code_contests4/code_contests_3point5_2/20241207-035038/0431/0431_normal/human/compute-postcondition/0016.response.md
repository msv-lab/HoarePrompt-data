Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the result of `i - carry`. The previous values of `i` and `carry` are required to calculate the new value of `i`. 
Output State: **`bags` is updated by 2, `carry` is the remainder of `i` divided by `k`, `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over, `i` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `i - carry`**
