Example Answer:
`bags` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `bags` is unknown, so the output state is: `bags` is incremented by 1, `carry` is the remainder of the last `i` divided by `k`, `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over, `carry` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`bags` is incremented by 1, `carry` is the remainder of the last `i` divided by `k`, `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over, `carry` is not equal to 0**
