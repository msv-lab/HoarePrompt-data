Postcondition: ***`bags` is the total number of bags calculated according to the loop, `carry` is the remainder of the last `i` divided by `k`, `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over. If `carry` is not equal to 0, `bags` is incremented by 1 and `carry` is updated to the remainder of the last `i` divided by `k`. Additionally, `a` still has at least one element left to iterate over.***
