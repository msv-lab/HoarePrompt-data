The function `func_2` reads input values for `n` and `k`, as well as a list of integers `a`. It then calls `func_1` twice with different arguments derived from `a` and `k`, and prints the minimum result obtained from these calls. The actual calculations and return values of `func_1` are not specified in the given information.
