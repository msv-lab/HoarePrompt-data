Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage for a given set of days. The function takes in a list of garbage units produced on each day and the capacity of each bag as input. It iterates over the list of garbage units, calculates the number of bags needed for each day, and keeps track of any remaining garbage units that could not fit into a bag.

The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` twice (once for the original list of garbage units and once for the reversed list) to consider the case where Vasya disposes of garbage the next day, and then prints the minimum number of bags needed.

The program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of bags required to dispose of all garbage considering the constraints provided. The logic of the program aligns with the problem requirements and there are no obvious edge cases where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
