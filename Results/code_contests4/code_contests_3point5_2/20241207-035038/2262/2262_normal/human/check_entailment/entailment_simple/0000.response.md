Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input grid, counts the total number of 'X' tokens, calculates the maximum number of tokens to change to achieve a draw, assigns colors to cells based on their position in the grid, determines the color to change tokens to achieve the draw configuration, and updates the grid accordingly. The program then prints the modified grid for each test case. It ensures that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300, which is a requirement in the problem description. The program always achieves the goal of making the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations, as specified.
