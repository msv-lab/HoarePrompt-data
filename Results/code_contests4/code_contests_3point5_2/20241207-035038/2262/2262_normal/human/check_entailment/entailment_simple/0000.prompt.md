You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type O do not appear in the input of the easy version.

Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.

In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are n rows and n columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: X and O. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.

<image> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations. The patterns in the second row are draw configurations. 

In an operation, you can change an X to an O, or an O to an X. Let k denote the total number of tokens in the grid. Your task is to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ (rounding down) operations.

You are not required to minimize the number of operations.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 300) — the size of the grid.

The following n lines each contain a string of n characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the i-th row and j-th column is '.' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: 'X' or 'O'.

It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.

In the easy version, the character 'O' does not appear in the input.

The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.

Output

For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.

We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

XXX.XX
XXXXXX
XX.X.X

5
XXX.X
.X..X
XXX.X

Output


.X.

.X.
XX.XXO
XOXXOX
OXX.XX
XOOXXO
XX.X.X
OXXOXX
XOX.X
.X..X
XXO.O
..X..
..X..

Note

In the first test case, there are initially three 'X' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to 'O' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed 1≤ ⌊ 5/3⌋ token.

In the second test case, we change only 9≤ ⌊ 32/3⌋ tokens, and there does not exist any three 'X' or 'O' consecutive in a row or column, so it is a draw.

In the third test case, we change only 3≤ ⌊ 12/3⌋ tokens, and the resulting grid is a draw.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). The input grid contains characters '.' (empty cell) or 'X' (token type). The character 'O' does not appear in the input in the easy version.**
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns the integer value obtained from the input

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer. n is a positive integer less than or equal to 300. Each character in the grid is either '.' or 'X'.**
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers created by mapping the input split by spaces to integers

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**
**n is a positive integer representing the size of the grid for each test case.**
**The grid for each test case is represented by an n x n matrix where each cell contains either '.', 'X', or 'O'.**
**The character 'O' does not appear in the input of the easy version.**
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #The program returns a list containing the input for each test case represented by an n x n matrix where each cell contains either '.', 'X', or 'O'

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer. n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 300. Each cell in the grid is either empty (denoted by '.') or contains a token (either 'X' or 'O'). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 300.**
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns the string s without the last character

#Function 5:

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
