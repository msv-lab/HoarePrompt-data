Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the size of the grid, and the initial grid configuration.
2. It then calculates the total number of 'X' tokens in the grid and determines the number of operations needed to make the grid a draw.
3. The code follows the rules of changing 'X' tokens to 'O' tokens to achieve a draw configuration in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations.
4. The code ensures that there are no three consecutive 'X' tokens in a row or column after the modifications.
5. The output generated by the code matches the expected grid state after applying the operations for each test case.
