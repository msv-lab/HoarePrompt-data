Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program seems to correctly implement the problem description. It reads the input, calculates the number of 'X' tokens, assigns 'O' tokens based on a specific condition to make the grid a draw, and prints the modified grid. The code logic aligns with the problem statement, and there are no evident edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, supporting the correctness of the program.
