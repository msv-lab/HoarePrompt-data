Postcondition: ***`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n+1`, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is increased by the total number of times `clr[i, j] == use_clr` for all `j` in `xrange(n)`, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M` after the loop finishes.***
