Example Answer:
The value of clr[i, j] is updated to (i + j) % 3. Since i is 0 and j is 2, (i + j) % 3 is 2. Therefore, clr[i, j] is updated to 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **clr is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> 2 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, clr is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> -1, cnt is a list [1, 1, 0] if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, cnt is a list [1, 0, 0], i is 0, n is greater than 0, j is 2 for the next iteration**
