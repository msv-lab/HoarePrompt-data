Example Answer:
The value at index `(i + j) % 3` in list `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the index calculated is 2. If the previous value at this index in `cnt` was 0, it becomes 1. Therefore, the Output State is: clr is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> 2 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, clr is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> -1, cnt is a list [1, 1, 1] if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, cnt is a list [1, 0, 1], i is 0, n is greater than 0, j is 2 for the next iteration.
Output State: **clr is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> 2 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, clr is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> -1, cnt is a list [1, 1, 1] if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, cnt is a list [1, 0, 1], i is 0, n is greater than 0, j is 2 for the next iteration**
