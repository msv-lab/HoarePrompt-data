The function `func_3()` is called and its return value is appended to the list `M`. The initial state does not provide information about the return value of `func_3()`, so we cannot determine the exact output state. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0, the input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, k is 0, M is appended with the return value of `func_3()`.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0, the input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, k is 0, M is appended with the return value of `func_3()`**
