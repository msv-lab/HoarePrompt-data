Output State: **`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list with 3 elements, where each element represents the count of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively based on the values of (i + j) % 3. `i` remains 0, `n` is the same as the initial value, and `j` is equal to n for the loop to finish.**
