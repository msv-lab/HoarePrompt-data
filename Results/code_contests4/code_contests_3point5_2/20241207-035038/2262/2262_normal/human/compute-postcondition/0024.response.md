According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> 0 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list [1, 0, 0] if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `cnt` is a list [0, 0, 0]. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` remains 0 after the if else block executes. Since `j` is the iterating variable, it needs to be updated for the next iteration. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> 0 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list [1, 0, 0] if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `cnt` is a list [0, 0, 0]. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1 for the next iteration**
