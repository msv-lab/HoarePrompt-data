Postcondition: ***`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> 0, 1, or 2 if M[i][j] != 'X', (i, j) -> -1 if M[i][j] == 'X' and now specifically (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3, `cnt` is a list with 3 elements, where one of the elements has been incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is equal to n-2 for the loop to execute the first time.***
