Example Answer:
The value of `chg` is increased by 1. The previous value of `chg` is unknown, so after execution, `chg` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n+1`, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is increased by 1, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`.
Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n+1`, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is increased by 1, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`**
