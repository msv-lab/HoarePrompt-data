According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0. In the last element of M, the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' is k, and M is appended with the return value of `func_3()`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, the input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, k is the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of M, M is appended with the return value of `func_3()` for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than 0**
