Example Answer:
The code `cnt[(i + j) % 3] += 1` increments the count at index `(i + j) % 3` by 1. Since `j` is 1, the updated index will be `(i + 1) % 3`. The values of `clr` and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr` is updated with new key-value pairs based on (i + j) % 3, `cnt` is updated with counts of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively, with count at index 0 increased by 1, `j` is 1 for the next iteration.
Output State: **`clr` is updated with new key-value pairs based on (i + j) % 3, `cnt` is updated with counts of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively, with count at index 0 increased by 1, `j` is 1 for the next iteration**
