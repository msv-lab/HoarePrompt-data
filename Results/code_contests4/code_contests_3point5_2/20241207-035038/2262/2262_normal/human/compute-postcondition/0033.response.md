Postcondition: ***`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> 2 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list [1, 1, 1] if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `cnt` is a list [1, 0, 1]. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2 for the next iteration.***
