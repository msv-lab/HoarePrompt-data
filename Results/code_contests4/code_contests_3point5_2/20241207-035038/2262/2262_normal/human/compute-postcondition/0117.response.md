Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is increased by 1, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M` after the loop finishes. The value at position `(i, j)` in `clr` is equal to `use_clr`**
