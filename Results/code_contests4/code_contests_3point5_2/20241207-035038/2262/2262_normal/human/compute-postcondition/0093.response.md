According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `n`, `use_clr` is updated to 3, `chg` is incremented by 2, the value at position `(i, j)` in `clr` is equal to `use_clr`, `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O'. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `use_clr` is updated to 3, `chg` is incremented by 2, the value at position `(i, j)` in `clr` is equal to `use_clr`, `M[i][j]` is assigned the value 'O'**
