Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial value, `j` is equal to `n`, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is equal to the total number of times `clr[i, j] == use_clr` for all `j` in `xrange(n)`, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`, for the loop to execute a second time the current row of `M[i]` will be printed as a string.**
