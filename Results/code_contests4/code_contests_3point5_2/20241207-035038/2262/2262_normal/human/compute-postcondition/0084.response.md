According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` is 0, `j` is equal to n, and `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `use_clr` should be updated to 3 after the loop finishes.
State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to n, `use_clr` is updated to 3 after the loop finishes, `chg` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0**
