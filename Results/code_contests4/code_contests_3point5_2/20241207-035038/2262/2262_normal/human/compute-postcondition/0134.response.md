Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints the current row of `M[i]` as a string. The value of `i` is 2, so the second row of `M` will be printed. The values of `clr`, `cnt`, `n`, `j`, `use_clr`, and `chg` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is the same as the initial value, `j` is equal to `n`, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is equal to the total number of times `clr[i, j] == use_clr` for all `j` in `xrange(n)`, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`, the current row of `M[i]` is printed as a string.
Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is the same as the initial value, `j` is equal to `n`, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is equal to the total number of times `clr[i, j] == use_clr` for all `j` in `xrange(n)`, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`, the current row of `M[i]` is printed as a string.**
