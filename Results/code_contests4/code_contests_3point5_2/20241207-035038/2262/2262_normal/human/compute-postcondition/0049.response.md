Example Answer:
`clr` is updated with new key-value pairs based on the formula (i + j) % 3. The value of `i` is not specified, so the new key-value pairs will depend on the value of `i` when this code is executed. `cnt` is updated with counts of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively, with the count at index 0 increased by 1. `j` is updated to 1 for the next iteration.
Output State: **`clr` is updated with new key-value pairs based on (i + j) % 3, `cnt` is updated with counts of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively, with count at index 0 increased by 1, `j` is 1 for the next iteration.**
