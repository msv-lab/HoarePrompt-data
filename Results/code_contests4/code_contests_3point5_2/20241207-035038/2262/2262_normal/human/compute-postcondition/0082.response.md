Example Answer:
`chg` is assigned the value 0. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `j` remains equal to n, `use_clr` is updated to 3 after the loop finishes, `chg` is 0.
Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `j` remains equal to n, `use_clr` is updated to 3 after the loop finishes, `chg` is 0**
