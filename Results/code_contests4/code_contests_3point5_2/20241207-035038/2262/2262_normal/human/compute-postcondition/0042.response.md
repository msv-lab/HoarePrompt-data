Postcondition: ***`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of (i + j) % 3 for all valid i, j. If M[i][j] != 'X', `clr` has key-value pairs (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list with 3 elements representing the count of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively based on the values of (i + j) % 3. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to the value of n-1 for the next iteration. After the if else block, `clr` is updated with key-value pairs based on the formula (i + j) % 3, `cnt` is updated with counts of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively, with count at index 0 increased by 1. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0 for the next iteration.***
