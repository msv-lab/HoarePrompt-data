Example Answer: 
`clr` is a dictionary that assigns -1 to the key (i, j). This means that the value corresponding to the key (i, j) will now be -1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise (i, j) -> -1, `cnt` is a list with 3 elements, where one of the elements has been incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is equal to n for the loop to execute one more time.
