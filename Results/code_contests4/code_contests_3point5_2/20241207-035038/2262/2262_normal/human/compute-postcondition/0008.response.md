Example Answer:
k is incremented by the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of M. The value of k is the sum of occurrences of 'X' and 'O' in the last element of M. The input grid does not contain 'O' in the easy version, so k is incremented by the sum of occurrences of 'X' in the last element of M. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0, input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, k is the sum of occurrences of 'X' in the last element of M, M is appended with the return value of func_3() for the loop to execute another time n must be greater than 0.
