Postcondition: ***`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to n, `use_clr` is updated to 3 after the loop finishes, `chg` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. The value at position `(i, j)` in `clr` is equal to `use_clr`***
