According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 0. Since t is a positive integer, it does not affect the loop execution. Since k is 0, it also does not affect the loop execution. The input grid does not affect the loop execution in this case. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is n being greater than 0.

State: **t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0, the input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, k is 0**
