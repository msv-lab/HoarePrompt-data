Output State: **`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `clr` is a dictionary with key-value pair (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list [1, 1, 0] if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise, `cnt` is a list [0, 0, 0]. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1 for the next iteration.**
