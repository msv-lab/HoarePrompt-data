According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, `k` is the sum of occurrences of 'X' in the last element of M, M is appended with the return value of func_3(). So for the loop to execute another time, `n` must be greater than 0.
