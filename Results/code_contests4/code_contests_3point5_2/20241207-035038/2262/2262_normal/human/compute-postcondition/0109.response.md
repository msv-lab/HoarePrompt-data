Example Answer:
The value at position `(i, j)` in matrix `M` is updated to 'O'. Since `j` is equal to `n+1`, the loop will execute one more time. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n+1,` `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is increased, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`.
Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n+1,` `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is increased, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`**
