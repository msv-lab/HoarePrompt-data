Output State: **`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise (i, j) -> -1, `cnt` is a list with 3 elements representing the count of occurrences of 0, 1, and 2 respectively based on the values of (i + j) % 3, `i` is 0, `n` is the same as the initial value, `j` is equal to n for the loop to finish, `use_clr` is updated and for the loop to execute again `use_clr` should be less than 3 and either `cnt[use_clr]` should be greater than `K` or `cnt[use_clr]` should be equal to 0, `use_clr` is incremented by 1**
