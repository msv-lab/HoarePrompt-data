Output State: **`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise (i, j) -> -1, `cnt` is a list with 3 elements, where one of the elements has been incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to n for the loop to execute one more time, and `clr[i, j]` is assigned the value `n % 3; `cnt` list has one of its elements incremented by 1 based on the calculation `(i + j) % 3`, `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 0, and `j` is now equal to n+1.**
