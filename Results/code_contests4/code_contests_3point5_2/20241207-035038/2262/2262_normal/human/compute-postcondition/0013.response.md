Example Answer:
K is assigned the value of k divided by 3.0. Since k is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' in all elements of M, and K is an integer, the division result will be rounded down. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0, input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, k is the total sum of occurrences of 'X' in all elements of M, M contains the return values of func_3() for each iteration of the loop, K is the integer value of k divided by 3.
