Postcondition: ***`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list with 3 elements, where one of the elements has been incremented by 1 based on the calculation `(i + j) % 3`. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to n+1.***
