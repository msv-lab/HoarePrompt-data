Example Answer:
The value of k is incremented by the sum of occurrences of 'X' in the last element of M. The sum is calculated by iterating over the last element of M and counting the occurrences of 'X'. The previous value of k is the sum of occurrences of 'X' in the last element of M before the increment. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is greater than 0, input grid contains characters '.', 'X', and 'O' with 'O' not appearing in the input of the easy version, k is the updated sum of occurrences of 'X' in the last element of M, M is appended with the return value of func_3() for the loop to execute another time n must be greater than 0.
