Functionality: **The function `func_5` initializes a matrix `M` based on the return values of another function `func_3`. It then calculates the total occurrences of 'X' in `M` and assigns colors 'O' based on a specific condition. The function prints the modified matrix `M` row by row. The key functionality is updating the matrix `M` based on the color condition and printing it. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
