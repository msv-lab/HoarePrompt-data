Example Answer: 
The value of `M` at position `(i, j)` is updated to 'O'. The state of the program indicates that this update occurs only when `clr[i, j] == use_clr`. Thus, after this execution, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` will have been updated to 'O' in `M`. The variable `chg` will be increased by the total number of times `clr[i, j] == use_clr` for all `j` in `xrange(n)`. The loop will execute for all valid `i` and `j` indices. After the loop finishes, `use_clr` will be updated to 3.
Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n+1`, `use_clr` is 3, `chg` is increased by the total number of times `clr[i, j] == use_clr` for all `j` in `xrange(n)`, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`.**
