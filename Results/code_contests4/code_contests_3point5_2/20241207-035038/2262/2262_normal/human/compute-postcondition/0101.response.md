Output State: **`clr` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n`, `use_clr` is updated to 3 after the loop finishes, `chg` is equal to the total number of times `clr[i, j] == use_clr` for all `j` in `xrange(n)`, all positions `(i, j)` in `clr` where `clr[i, j] == use_clr` have been updated to 'O' in `M`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, if `clr[i, j] == use_clr` then the state of the program is such that this condition is true.**
