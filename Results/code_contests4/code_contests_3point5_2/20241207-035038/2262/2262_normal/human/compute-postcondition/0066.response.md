Postcondition: ***`clr` is a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> (i + j) % 3 if M[i][j] == 'X', otherwise (i, j) -> -1. `cnt` is a list with 3 elements, where one of the elements has been incremented by 1. `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is equal to n-1 for the loop to execute one more time.***
