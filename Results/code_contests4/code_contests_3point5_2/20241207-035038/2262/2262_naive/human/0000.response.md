Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself. It calculates the total number of tokens in the grid and determines the number of operations needed to make the grid a draw. The program then assigns colors to each cell based on the sum of row and column indices. It iterates through the grid, identifies the color with the fewest occurrences, and changes tokens accordingly to make the grid a draw.

The implementation follows the problem description accurately by considering all the requirements such as changing tokens to make the grid a draw in at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations and ensuring that there are no consecutive tokens of the same type in a row or column. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided where the program would not behave as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
