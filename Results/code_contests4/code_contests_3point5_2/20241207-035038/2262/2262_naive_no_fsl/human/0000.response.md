Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program takes input for multiple test cases, processes each test case according to the problem description, and outputs the state of the grid after applying the operations to make it a draw configuration.

The program correctly calculates the number of tokens in the grid, determines the number of operations required to make it a draw, assigns colors to cells based on their position, selects the color with the least tokens to change to 'O', and updates the grid accordingly.

The program follows the problem description and ensures that the resulting grid is a draw configuration with at most ⌊ k/3⌋ operations for each test case.

Since the program handles the given problem description correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is evaluated as True.
