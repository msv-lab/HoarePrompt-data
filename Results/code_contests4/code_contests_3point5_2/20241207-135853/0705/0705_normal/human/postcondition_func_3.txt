The function `func_4` takes a string `w` of length 10 containing only '0's and '1's, and an integer `m` in the range of 1 to 1000 as input. It then iterates through the string `w`, finds the positions of '1's, and stores them in a list `result`, which is returned. The function accurately returns the list of positions of '1's in the string `w`.
