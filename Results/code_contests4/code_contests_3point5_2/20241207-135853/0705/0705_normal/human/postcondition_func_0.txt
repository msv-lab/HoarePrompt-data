The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `result` which is expected to be a list. If the first element of `result` is true, it prints 'YES' followed by printing all elements of the list. If the first element of `result` is false, it prints 'NO'. However, the function lacks a clear specification regarding its purpose or expected behavior for cases where `result` does not meet the expected list structure.
