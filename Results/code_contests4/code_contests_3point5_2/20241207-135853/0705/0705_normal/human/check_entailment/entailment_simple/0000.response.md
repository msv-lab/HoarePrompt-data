Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The functions defined do not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The functions do not take into account the rules imposed by Xenia on placing the weights on the scales, such as the weights being different from each other and the sum of weights on one scalepan outweighing the other. 

There is no logic in the functions to handle these constraints. As a result, the program will not always produce the correct output according to the problem description. Additional logic needs to be implemented to ensure that the weights are placed correctly on the scales while following Xenia's rules.
