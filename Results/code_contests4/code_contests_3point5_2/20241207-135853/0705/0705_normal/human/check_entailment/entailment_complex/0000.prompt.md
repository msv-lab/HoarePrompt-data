You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales. Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos. Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little. For this, she puts weights on the scalepans, one by one. The first weight goes on the left scalepan, the second weight goes on the right scalepan, the third one goes on the left scalepan, the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on. Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepans.

Simply putting weights on the scales is not interesting, so Xenia has set some rules. First, she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight. That is, the weight that goes i-th should be different from the (i + 1)-th weight for any i (1 ≤ i < m). Second, every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan, she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one. That is, the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other pan.

You are given all types of weights available for Xenia. You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type. Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on ​​the scales or to say that it can't be done.

Input

The first line contains a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones: the i-th (i ≥ 1) character in the line equals "1" if Xenia has i kilo weights, otherwise the character equals "0". The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).

Output

In the first line print "YES", if there is a way to put m weights on the scales by all rules. Otherwise, print in the first line "NO". If you can put m weights on the scales, then print in the next line m integers — the weights' weights in the order you put them on the scales.

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(result):
    if result[0] :
        print('YES')
        for i in result[1]:
            print(i),
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 'YES'
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The program's result consists of a list. If the first element of the result is true, the outcome is 'YES'. Otherwise, if the first element of the result is false, the program's result is a list with the first element being False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `result` which is expected to be a list. If the first element of `result` is true, it prints 'YES' followed by printing all elements of the list. If the first element of `result` is false, it prints 'NO'. However, the function lacks a clear specification regarding its purpose or expected behavior for cases where `result` does not meet the expected list structure.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones representing the available weights, w is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.**
def func_2(l, w, m):
    if (len(l) == m) :
        return True, l
        #The program returns True and the string l representing the available weights consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones
    else :
        i = 0
        for i in func_3(l, w):
            tmp = func_2(l + [i], w, m)
            
            if tmp[0]:
                return True, tmp[1]
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `l` is a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones, `w` is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `i` is adjusted based on the output of `func_3(l, w)`, `tmp` is assigned the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`. If at any point during the iterations, tmp[0] is True, the program will return True and the second element of the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.
        return False,
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `l`, an integer `w`, and an integer `m`, and iterates through a loop to modify `l` based on the output of another function `func_3`. If a certain condition is met during the iteration, it returns True along with specific values. However, the actual behavior of the function based on the code may not align with all the annotated return conditions. Additional edge cases and missing functionality might exist that are not covered in the annotations.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: seq is a string of length 10 consisting of only zeroes and ones, and weights is an integer such that 1 <= weights <= 1000.**
def func_3(seq, weights):
    if seq :
        tmp = abs(sum(seq[0::2]) - sum(seq[1::2]))
        result = [i for i in weights if i > tmp and i != seq[-1]]
        return result
        #The program returns a list of elements in weights that are greater than tmp and not equal to the last element of seq
    else :
        return weights
        #The program returns the integer value of weights, which is in the range of 1 to 1000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a string `seq` of length 10 consisting of only zeroes and ones, and an integer `weights` in the range of 1 to 1000. If the string `seq` is not empty, it calculates the absolute difference between the sums of elements at even and odd indices in `seq`, then returns a list of elements from `weights` that are greater than this difference and not equal to the last element of `seq`. If `seq` is empty, the function simply returns the integer value of `weights`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a string of length 10 containing only '0's and '1's, and an integer m such that 1 <= m <= 1000.**
def func_4(w):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(w) + 1):
        if w[i - 1] == '1':
            result.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is a list containing the positions of '1's in the string `w`, `w` is a string of length 10 containing only '0's and '1's, `m` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000
    return result
    #The program returns the list containing the positions of '1's in the string `w`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a string `w` of length 10 containing only '0's and '1's, and an integer `m` in the range of 1 to 1000 as input. It then iterates through the string `w`, finds the positions of '1's, and stores them in a list `result`, which is returned. The function accurately returns the list of positions of '1's in the string `w`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
