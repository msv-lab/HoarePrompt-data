Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` lacks clear handling for cases where Xenia cannot put the total of m weights on the scalepans as per the given rules. The code does not explicitly check and handle scenarios where it is impossible to satisfy the conditions specified by Xenia. This lack of coverage for such cases makes the program incorrect. The annotations do not always align with the code logic, leading to potential discrepancies between the expected behavior and the actual implementation.
