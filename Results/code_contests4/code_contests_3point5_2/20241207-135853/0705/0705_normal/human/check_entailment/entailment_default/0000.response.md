# Initial Assessment:
Based on the problem description, Xenia needs to place weights on two scalepans according to specific rules. The code provided seems to have multiple functions that work together to determine if Xenia can successfully place the weights on the scales. The functions seem to follow the requirements of the problem statement, but we need to carefully analyze if they cover all potential cases and edge cases.

# Checking with Output Hints:
- **Function 1 (func_1):** The output hints for this function mention that if the result is True, it prints 'YES' followed by the elements in the list. If it is False, it prints 'NO'. This aligns with the problem description as it should output 'YES' or 'NO' based on Xenia's ability to place the weights correctly.
- **Function 2 (func_2):** This function iterates through a loop to find a solution for placing the weights. The output hints do not provide much information, so we need to analyze the code further to see if it handles all possible cases correctly.
- **Function 3 (func_3):** This function calculates the weights that can be placed on the scalepans based on the current sequence of weights. It seems to follow the rules specified in the problem description.
- **Function 4 (func_4):** This function extracts the positions of weights with value '1' from the input string, which is necessary for further calculations in the other functions.

# Final Assessment:
After analyzing the code and output hints, it appears that the provided functions are correctly implemented to determine if Xenia can place the weights on the scales according to the given rules. The functions cover the rules mentioned in the problem description and seem to handle various scenarios effectively.

Correctness: **True**.
