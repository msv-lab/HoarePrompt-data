Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a string `l`, an integer `w`, and an integer `m`, and iterates through a loop to modify `l` based on the output of another function `func_3`. If a certain condition is met during the iteration, it returns True along with specific values. However, the actual behavior of the function based on the code may not align with all the annotated return conditions. Additional edge cases and missing functionality might exist that are not covered in the annotations. **
