The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones representing the available weights; `w`, an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales; and `m`, an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. 

After executing the function body, there are multiple return points:

Case_1: If the program returns True and the string `l` representing the available weights consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones.

Case_2: If the program returns True and the second element of the list 'tmp'.

Case_3: If the program returns True and the second element of the list 'tmp'.

Case_4: If the program returns True and the second element of the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`.

Case_5: If the program returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a string `l`, an integer `w`, and an integer `m`, and return different values based on the conditions specified in the return points.
