Postcondition: ***`result` is a list containing the values of `i + 2`, `i + 1`, and `i`; `w` is a string of length at least `i + 2` containing only '0's and '1's with the character at index `i + 1` being '1'; `m` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000. When `w[i - 1] == '1'`, the loop will execute a second time with the length of `w` being at least `i + 2`.***
