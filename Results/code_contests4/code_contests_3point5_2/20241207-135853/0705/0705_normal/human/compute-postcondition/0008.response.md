According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `w`. If `i` is less than the length of `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is a list containing the value of `i + 1` and `i`, `w` is a string of length at least `i + 1` containing only '0's and '1's with the character at index `i` being '1', `m` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `result` should contain the value of `i + 2` and `i + 1`
- `w` should be a string of length at least `i + 2` containing only '0's and '1's with the character at index `i + 1` being '1'
- `m` remains the same
- For the loop to execute again, the length of `w` must be at least `i + 2`.

State: **`result` is a list containing the value of `i + 2` and `i + 1`, `w` is a string of length at least `i + 2` containing only '0's and '1's with the character at index `i + 1` being '1', `m` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, for the loop to execute a second time length of `w` is at least `i + 2`**
