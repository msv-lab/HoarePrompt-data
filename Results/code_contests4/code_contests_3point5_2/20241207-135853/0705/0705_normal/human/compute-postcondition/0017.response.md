Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `l` is a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones, `w` is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `i` is adjusted based on the output of `func_3(l, w)`, `tmp` is assigned the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`. If at any point during the iterations, tmp[0] is True, the program will return True and the second element of the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**
