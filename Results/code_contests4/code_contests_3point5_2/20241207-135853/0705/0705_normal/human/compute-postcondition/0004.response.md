Postcondition: ***`result` is a list containing the value of `i`, `w` is a string of length 10 containing only '0's and '1's, `m` is an integer in the range 1 to 1000, for the loop to execute the first time length of `w` is at least 1. If the character at index `i - 1` in string `w` is '1', then `result` will contain the value of `i`***
