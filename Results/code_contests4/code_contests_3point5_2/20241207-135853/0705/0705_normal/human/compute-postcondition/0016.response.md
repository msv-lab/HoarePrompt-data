Postcondition: ***l is a string consisting of exactly ten zeroes and ones, w is an integer representing the total number of weights to be placed on the scales (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), i is adjusted based on the output of `func_3(l, w), tmp` is assigned the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`. If tmp[0] is True, then the program returns True and the second element of the result of `func_2(l + [i], w, m)`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
