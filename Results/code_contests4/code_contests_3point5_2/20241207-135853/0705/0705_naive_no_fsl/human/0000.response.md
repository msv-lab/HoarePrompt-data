Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

One potential case where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
```
0000000001
2
```
Output:
```
NO
```
Explanation:
According to the problem description, Xenia should not put two consecutive weights of the same weight, which the program does not handle correctly in this case. The weights are 1 kilo each, and the program should output "NO" since it is not possible to put 2 weights on the scales without violating the rules. However, the program does not consider the consecutive weights condition, resulting in incorrect output.
