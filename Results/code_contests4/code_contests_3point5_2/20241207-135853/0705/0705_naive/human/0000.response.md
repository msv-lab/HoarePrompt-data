Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the rules described in the problem statement. The program should ensure that two consecutive weights are not the same and that the sum of weights on one scalepan is strictly greater than the sum on the other pan. However, the current implementation does not handle these constraints properly. The program may generate incorrect outputs for certain cases where the rules are violated.
