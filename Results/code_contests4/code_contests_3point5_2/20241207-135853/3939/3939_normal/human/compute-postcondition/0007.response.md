According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is 3, `memo` is a tuple containing 3 and 6, `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 0, `y` is 3, `value` is 6**
