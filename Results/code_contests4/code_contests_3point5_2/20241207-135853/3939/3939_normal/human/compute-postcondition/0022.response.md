Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then iterates through a loop to calculate a specific value based on the previous values in `memo`. If `n` is greater than 2, it prints the second element of `memo`, otherwise, it prints 0 if `n` is 1 and 3 if `n` is 2. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
