Example Answer:
The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a large number used for modulo operations. The values of `n` and `memo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string, `memo` is a tuple containing 0 and 3, `MOD` is 1000000007.
Output State: **`n` is a string, `memo` is a tuple containing 0 and 3, `MOD` is 1000000007**
