Example Answer:
The value of `value` is calculated as 2 times the value of `y` (which is 24) plus 3 times the value of `x` (which is 6). Therefore, `value` becomes 48 + 18 = 66. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is 3, `memo` is a tuple containing 6 and 24, `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 6, `y` is 24, `value` is 66**
