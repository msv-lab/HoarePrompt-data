Example Answer: 
`memo` is assigned the values of `y` and `value % MOD`, which are 6 and 24 respectively. Therefore, after execution, `memo` contains the values 6 and 24. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is 3, `memo` is a tuple containing 6 and 24, `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 24**
