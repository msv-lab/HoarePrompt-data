According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. Since `n` is not directly modified within the loop, it remains the same. Therefore, the next iteration will have the following state:
State: **`n` is 3, `memo` is a tuple containing 6 and 24, `MOD` is 1000000007, `x` is 3, `y` is 6, `value` is 24**
