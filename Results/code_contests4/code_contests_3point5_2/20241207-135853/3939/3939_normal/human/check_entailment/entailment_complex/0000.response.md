Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps, considering the cyclic paths in a tetrahedron. The program uses the provided formula to calculate the number of ways and prints the result modulo 1000000007. The annotations also confirm that the program executes as expected based on the problem description. Thus, the program is correct and outputs the expected results.
