Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from the initial vertex D to itself in exactly n steps. The code uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the number of ways for each step. The calculation is done based on the previous values in the `memo` tuple. The code handles the cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2 by directly returning the correct result. For `n` greater than 2, the code iterates through a loop to calculate the values and finally prints the required number of ways modulo 1000000007. The approach aligns with the problem description, and the code covers all potential cases as specified.
