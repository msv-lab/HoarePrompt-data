Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways the ant can go from vertex D to itself in exactly n steps in a cyclic path on a tetrahedron. It uses a memoization technique to keep track of the number of ways at each step, and then calculates the number of ways based on the previous steps. The program considers the case where n is less than or equal to 2 separately, and prints the correct result in all cases as described in the problem description. The final result is printed modulo 1000000007 as required. Hence, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
