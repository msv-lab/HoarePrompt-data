Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the number of ways in which the ant can go from the initial vertex D to itself in exactly n steps in a tetrahedron. It follows the formula for calculating the number of cyclic paths with the given length n. The program handles the base cases for n=1 and n=2 correctly, and for n>2, it iterates through and calculates the values using the memoization technique. The final result is printed modulo 1000000007. Since the program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output for each case, it can be considered correct.
