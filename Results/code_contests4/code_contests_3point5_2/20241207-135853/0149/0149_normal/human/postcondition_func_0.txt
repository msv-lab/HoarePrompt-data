The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`, decrements each element of `p` by 1, calculates the sum of absolute differences between the calculated values and the corresponding elements in `p` for even and odd indices separately. It then prints the minimum value between the sums of even and odd indices. The function does not return any value.
