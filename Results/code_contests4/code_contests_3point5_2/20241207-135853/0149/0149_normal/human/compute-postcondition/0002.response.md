Example Answer:
Each element `pi` in list `p` is decremented by 1 and the new list `p` is assigned to this updated list. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, and `p` is a list of integers, the output state will be: `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by 1**
