Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`, which reads an input from the standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespaces, and converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already defined as an even integer greater than or equal to 2 in the initial state, the value of `n` remains the same after execution.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2**
