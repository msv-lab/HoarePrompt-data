Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the input from the standard input after splitting it. The values of the integers are not specified, but `n` is known to be an even integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers**
