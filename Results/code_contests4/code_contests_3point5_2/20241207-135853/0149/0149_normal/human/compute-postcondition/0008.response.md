Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by 1, `even` is updated based on the calculation even += abs(i * 2 - p[i]), `odd` is the absolute difference between 1 and (p[0] + 1), `i` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `even` is updated with the new calculation result**
