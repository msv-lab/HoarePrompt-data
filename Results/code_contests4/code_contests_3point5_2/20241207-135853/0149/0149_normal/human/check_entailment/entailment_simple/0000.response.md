Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum number of moves needed to place all pieces on cells of the same color, and then prints the result. The program iterates through the positions of the pieces and calculates the sum of absolute differences between the calculated positions based on whether the index is even or odd. It then outputs the minimum of these two sums, which represents the minimum number of moves required to place all pieces on cells of the same color.

The program always follows the problem description because it effectively calculates the minimum number of moves required to achieve the desired configuration of all pieces on cells of the same color.
