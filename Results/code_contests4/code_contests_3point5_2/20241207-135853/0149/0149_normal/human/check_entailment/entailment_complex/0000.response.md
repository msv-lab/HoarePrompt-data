Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, decrements each element in the list `p` by 1, calculates the sum of absolute differences between the calculated values and the corresponding elements in `p` for even and odd indices separately, and then prints the minimum value between the sums of even and odd indices. This approach ensures that all the pieces are placed in cells of the same color using the minimum number of moves. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
