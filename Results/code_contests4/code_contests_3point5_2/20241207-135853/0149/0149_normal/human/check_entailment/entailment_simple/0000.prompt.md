You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a chessboard of size 1 × n. It is guaranteed that n is even. The chessboard is painted like this: "BWBW...BW".

Some cells of the board are occupied by the chess pieces. Each cell contains no more than one chess piece. It is known that the total number of pieces equals to <image>.

In one step you can move one of the pieces one cell to the left or to the right. You cannot move pieces beyond the borders of the board. You also cannot move pieces to the cells that are already occupied.

Your task is to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color using the minimum number of moves (all the pieces must occupy only the black cells or only the white cells after all the moves are made).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, n is even) — the size of the chessboard. 

The second line of the input contains <image> integer numbers <image> (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — initial positions of the pieces. It is guaranteed that all the positions are distinct.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves you have to make to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color.

Examples

Input

6
1 2 6


Output

2


Input

10
1 2 3 4 5


Output

10

Note

In the first example the only possible strategy is to move the piece at the position 6 to the position 5 and move the piece at the position 2 to the position 3. Notice that if you decide to place the pieces in the white cells the minimum number of moves will be 3.

In the second example the possible strategy is to move <image> in 4 moves, then <image> in 3 moves, <image> in 2 moves and <image> in 1 move.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer greater than or equal to 2.**
def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    p = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
    p = [(pi - 1) for pi in p]
    even = odd = 0
    for i in range(n / 2):
        even += abs(i * 2 - p[i])
        
        odd += abs(i * 2 + 1 - p[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative even integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by 1, `even` is the sum of absolute differences between the calculated values and p[i] for even indices i, `odd` is the sum of absolute differences between the calculated values and p[i] for odd indices i
    print(min(even, odd))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
