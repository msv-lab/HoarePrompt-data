Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and a list of integers `p`.
- It decrements each element of `p` by 1 to adjust for 0-based indexing.
- It calculates the sum of absolute differences between the calculated values and the corresponding elements in `p` for even and odd indices separately.
- Finally, it prints the minimum value between the sums of even and odd indices, which represents the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
