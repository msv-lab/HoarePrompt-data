Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color. It considers both even and odd positions of the pieces and calculates the absolute difference between the current position and the desired position for each piece. Finally, it takes the minimum of the total moves required for even and odd positions. Since the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
