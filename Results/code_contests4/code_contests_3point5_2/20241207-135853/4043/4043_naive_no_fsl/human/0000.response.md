Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program calculates the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen for the given positive integers A and B such that any two of the chosen divisors are coprime. It correctly finds all the divisors of A and B, checks if they are coprime, and counts the number of common divisors. The program handles the constraints provided (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^12) and follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the code is correct.
