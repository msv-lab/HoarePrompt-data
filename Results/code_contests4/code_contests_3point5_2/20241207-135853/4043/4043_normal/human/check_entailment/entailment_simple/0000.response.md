Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program is checking if a single number `n` is prime or not using a loop. However, the problem description requires finding the maximum number of positive common divisors of two given numbers `A` and `B` such that any two of the chosen divisors must be coprime.

The program does not address the actual requirements of the problem description and therefore does not produce the correct output for the given inputs.
