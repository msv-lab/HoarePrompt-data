Correctness: False

The provided annotated program is checking if a given number `n` is a prime number or not. However, the problem description requires finding the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen for given positive integers A and B such that any two chosen divisors are coprime.

The annotated program does not address the main problem description and therefore does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the Correctness is False.
