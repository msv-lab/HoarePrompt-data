Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if a given positive integer `n` is a prime number, but the implementation is incorrect. The function checks for divisors of `n` up to the square root of `n`, but it incorrectly returns True for `n = 1`, which is not a prime number. This will lead to incorrect results in cases where `n = 1`. Additionally, the code snippet provided is duplicated, which is unnecessary and may lead to confusion. Overall, the code needs to be revised to correctly identify prime numbers and remove the unnecessary duplication.
