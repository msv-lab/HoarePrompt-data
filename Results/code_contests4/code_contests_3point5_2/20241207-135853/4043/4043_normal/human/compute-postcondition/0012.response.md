Postcondition: ***`A` and `B` are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12. For the loop to execute the second time, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 4, and the condition (n % k == 0) is false. If n % k == 0, the program returns False. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables `A`, `B`, `n`, and `k`.***
