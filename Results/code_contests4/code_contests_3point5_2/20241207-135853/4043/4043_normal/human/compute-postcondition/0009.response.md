Postcondition: ***`A` and `B` are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is at least 5, `k` is 3, and the condition (n % k == 0) is false. If n % k == 0, the program returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
