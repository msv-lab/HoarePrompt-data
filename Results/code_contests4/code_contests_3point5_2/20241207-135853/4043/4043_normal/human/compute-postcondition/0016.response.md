Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if it is a prime number. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns True. If `n` is not a prime number or the loop does not complete without finding a factor, the function returns False. The function also returns True when `n` is equal to 1.**
