    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `A` and `B` are positive integers such that 1 <= A, B <= 10^12, n is not equal to 1. If n is a prime number, the loop will execute completely without returning False. Otherwise, if n is not a prime number, the loop will return False when it finds a factor of n.
    return True
    #The program returns True if n is a prime number and the loop executes completely without returning False. Otherwise, it returns False when it finds a factor of n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines if it is a prime number. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns True. If `n` is not a prime number or the loop does not complete without finding a factor, the function returns False. The function also returns True when `n` is equal to 1.
