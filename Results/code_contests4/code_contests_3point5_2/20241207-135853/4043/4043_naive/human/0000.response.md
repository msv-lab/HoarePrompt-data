Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen such that any two divisors are coprime. It first finds all the divisors of A and B, then checks if each divisor is a common divisor and coprime with each other. The program then counts the number of divisors that satisfy these conditions and prints the result. The logic and implementation seem correct, and the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
