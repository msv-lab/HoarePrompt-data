Correctness: **False**

The given Python program is incorrect. The issue lies in the `func_3` function where it always returns the sum of all characters in the substring instead of the number of different characters occurring in that substring. This violates the problem description where we need to count the number of different characters.

For example, consider the input:
```
7
abcdbbd
6
2 3 6
1 5 z
2 1 1
1 4 a
1 7 d
2 1 7
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
1
1
1
3
```

However, the program will output:
```
7
7
7
7
7
``` 

This shows that the program is not correctly counting the number of different characters in the substring as required by the problem description.
