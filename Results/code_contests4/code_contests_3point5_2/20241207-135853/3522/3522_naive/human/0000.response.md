Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the queries of type 1 correctly. In the function `func_2`, when updating the value of a character in the string, it should be updating the corresponding value in the segment tree, but it is not updating the segment tree correctly. This will lead to incorrect results when querying for the number of different characters in a substring.
