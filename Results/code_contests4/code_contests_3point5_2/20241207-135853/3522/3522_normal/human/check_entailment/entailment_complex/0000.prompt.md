You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

Process Q queries of the following two types:

* Type 1: change the i_q-th character of S to c_q. (Do nothing if the i_q-th character is already c_q.)
* Type 2: answer the number of different characters occurring in the substring of S between the l_q-th and r_q-th characters (inclusive).

Constraints

* N, Q, i_q, l_q, and r_q are integers.
* S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* c_q is a lowercase English letter.
* 1 \leq N \leq 500000
* 1 \leq Q \leq 20000
* |S| = N
* 1 \leq i_q \leq N
* 1 \leq l_q \leq r_q \leq N
* There is at least one query of type 2 in each testcase.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S
Q
Query_1
\vdots
Query_Q


Here, Query_i in the 4-th through (Q+3)-th lines is one of the following:


1 i_q c_q



2 l_q r_q


Output

For each query of type 2, print a line containing the answer.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(arr):
    for i in range(n):
        tree[ddd][n + i] = arr[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is at least 0, and `tree[ddd][n]` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, `tree[ddd][n + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `tree[ddd][ddd]` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, `tree[ddd][ddd + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`, and `tree[ddd][i]` contains the sum of all elements calculated during the loop execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a parameter `arr` and assigns values to elements in a tree data structure. It iterates through the elements of `arr` and populates the tree accordingly. The function does not specify any constraints on `arr` and does not provide a specific output. However, based on the code, it initializes values in the tree structure based on the elements of `arr`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `p` is updated according to the final value of `n`, `value` is assigned to `tree[ddd][p]`, `i` is assigned the final value after the loop finishes, and `tree[ddd][i >> 1]` is assigned the sum of `tree[ddd][i]` and `tree[ddd][i ^ 1`. The loop terminates when `i` is not greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts two parameters, p and value. It updates p based on the value of n, assigns the value to tree[ddd][p], and calculates the sum of tree values along the path in the tree structure. The function performs bitwise operations within a loop to update the tree values until i is not greater than 1. The function does not specify a return value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, Q, i_q, l_q, r_q are integers such that 1 <= N <= 500000, 1 <= Q <= 20000, 1 <= i_q <= N, 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N. S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. c_q is a lowercase English letter.**
def func_3(l, r):
    res = 0
    l += n
    r += n
    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` and `r` are halved. The loop will continue executing until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. `res` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns the final value of 'res' after the loop execution where 'l' and 'r' are halved and the loop continues until 'l' is greater than or equal to 'r'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both integers. It continuously halves both `l` and `r` in each iteration of the loop until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. The final value of the variable `res` is calculated based on specific conditions inside the loop and returned after the loop execution.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
