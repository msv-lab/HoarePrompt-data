The function `func_1` takes a parameter `arr` and assigns values to elements in a tree data structure. It iterates through the elements of `arr` and populates the tree accordingly. The function does not specify any constraints on `arr` and does not provide a specific output. However, based on the code, it initializes values in the tree structure based on the elements of `arr`.
