The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both integers. It continuously halves both `l` and `r` in each iteration of the loop until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. The final value of the variable `res` is calculated based on specific conditions inside the loop and returned after the loop execution.
