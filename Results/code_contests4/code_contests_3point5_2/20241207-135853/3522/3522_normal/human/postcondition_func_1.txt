The function func_2 accepts two parameters, p and value. It updates p based on the value of n, assigns the value to tree[ddd][p], and calculates the sum of tree values along the path in the tree structure. The function performs bitwise operations within a loop to update the tree values until i is not greater than 1. The function does not specify a return value.
