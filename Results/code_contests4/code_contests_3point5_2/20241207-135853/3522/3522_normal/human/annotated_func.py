def func_1(arr):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is at least 0, and `tree[ddd][n]` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, `tree[ddd][n + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        tree[ddd][i] = tree[ddd][i << 1] + tree[ddd][i << 1 | 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `tree[ddd][ddd]` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, `tree[ddd][ddd + i]` is assigned the value of `arr[i]`, and `tree[ddd][i]` contains the sum of all elements calculated during the loop execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a parameter `arr` and assigns values to elements in a tree data structure. It iterates through the elements of `arr` and populates the tree accordingly. The function does not specify any constraints on `arr` and does not provide a specific output. However, based on the code, it initializes values in the tree structure based on the elements of `arr`.

def func_2(p, value):
    p += n
    tree[ddd][p] = value
    i = p
    while i > 1:
        tree[ddd][i >> 1] = tree[ddd][i] + tree[ddd][i ^ 1]
        
        i >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `p` is updated according to the final value of `n`, `value` is assigned to `tree[ddd][p]`, `i` is assigned the final value after the loop finishes, and `tree[ddd][i >> 1]` is assigned the sum of `tree[ddd][i]` and `tree[ddd][i ^ 1`. The loop terminates when `i` is not greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts two parameters, p and value. It updates p based on the value of n, assigns the value to tree[ddd][p], and calculates the sum of tree values along the path in the tree structure. The function performs bitwise operations within a loop to update the tree values until i is not greater than 1. The function does not specify a return value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N, Q, i_q, l_q, r_q are integers such that 1 <= N <= 500000, 1 <= Q <= 20000, 1 <= i_q <= N, 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N. S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters. c_q is a lowercase English letter.**

    l += n

    while l < r:
        if l & 1:
            res += tree[ddd][l]
            l += 1
        
        if r & 1:
            r -= 1
            res += tree[ddd][r]
        
        l >>= 1
        
        r >>= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` and `r` are halved. The loop will continue executing until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. `res` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
    return res
    #The program returns the final value of 'res' after the loop execution where 'l' and 'r' are halved and the loop continues until 'l' is greater than or equal to 'r'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both integers. It continuously halves both `l` and `r` in each iteration of the loop until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. The final value of the variable `res` is calculated based on specific conditions inside the loop and returned after the loop execution.
