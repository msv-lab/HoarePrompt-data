Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both integers. It continuously halves both `l` and `r` in each iteration of the loop until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. The final value of the variable `res` is calculated based on specific conditions inside the loop and returned after the loop execution.** 

Potential Edge Cases:
1. If the initial value of `l` is already greater than or equal to `r`, the loop will not execute, and `res` will be 0.
2. The annotations mention variables like `n`, `tree`, `ddd` which are not defined in the function, potentially missing some context or implementation details.
