Output State: `N`, `Q`, `i_q`, `l_q`, `r_q`, `S`, `c_q`, `res`, `l`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= N <= 500000, 1 <= Q <= 20000, 1 <= i_q <= N, 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `c_q` is a lowercase English letter, `res` is updated by adding the value of `tree[ddd][l]`, `l` is added by n+1, `r` is increased by n, for the loop to execute the first time `l` must be less than `r`, `l` is an odd number.
