According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than `r`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, both `l` and `r` are halved. In order for the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be less than the new value of `r`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are: `l` is halved, `r` is halved and `l` is less than the new value of `r`.
State: **`l` is halved, `r` is halved and `l` is less than the new value of `r`**
