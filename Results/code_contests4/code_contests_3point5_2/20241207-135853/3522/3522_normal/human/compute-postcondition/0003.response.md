According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is less than `r`. Right before the loop, `res` is 0, `l` is added by `n`, and `r` is increased by `n`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be less than `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N`, `Q`, `i_q`, `l_q`, `r_q` are integers such that 1 <= N <= 500000, 1 <= Q <= 20000, 1 <= i_q <= N, 1 <= l_q <= r_q <= N, `S` is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `c_q` is a lowercase English letter, `res` is 0, `l` is added by n, `r` is increased by n, for the loop to execute the first time `l` must be less than `r`**
