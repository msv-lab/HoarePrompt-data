Example Answer:
The value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `l` affects the value of `res` as it is incremented by the value `tree[ddd][l]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: res is incremented by the new value of `tree[ddd][l]`, `l` is increased by 1.
Output State: **res is incremented by the new value of `tree[ddd][l]`, `l` is increased by 1**
