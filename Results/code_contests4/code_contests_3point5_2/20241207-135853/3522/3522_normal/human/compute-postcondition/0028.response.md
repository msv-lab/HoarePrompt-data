Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `tree[ddd][r]`. The previous values of `res` and `r` are unknown, so the output state is: `l` and `r` are halved, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than the new value of `r`. If `l` is an odd number, then `res` is incremented by the new value of `tree[ddd][l]` and `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`l` and `r` are halved, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than the new value of `r`. If `l` is an odd number, then `res` is incremented by the new value of `tree[ddd][l]` and `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1**
