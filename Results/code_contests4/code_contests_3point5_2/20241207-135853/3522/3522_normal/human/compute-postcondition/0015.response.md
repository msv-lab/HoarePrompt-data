Example Answer:
The value of `tree[ddd][l]` is added to `res`. The values of `ddd` and `l` are not given, but it is known that `l` is halved and `r` is halved, with `l` being less than the new value of `r`. Therefore, `res` is updated based on the value at `tree[ddd][l]`. 
Output State: **`res` is updated based on the value at `tree[ddd][l]`**
