The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both of which are integers. The function continues to halve both `l` and `r` in each iteration of a loop until `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. The final value of the variable `res` is returned after the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_3 is to accept two integers `l` and `r`, continuously halve them in each loop iteration, and return the final value of `res` after the loop execution.
