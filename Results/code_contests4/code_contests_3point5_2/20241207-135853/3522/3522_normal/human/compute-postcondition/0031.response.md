Example Answer:
The value of `r` is halved using right shift bitwise operator (`>>`). The previous value of `r` is unknown, so after execution, the new value of `r` will be half of its previous value. The loop will execute again only if the new value of `l` is less than the new value of `r`. 
Output State: **`l` and `r` are halved. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than the new value of `r`.**
