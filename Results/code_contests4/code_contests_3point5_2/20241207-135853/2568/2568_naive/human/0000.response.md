Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral as described in the problem statement. The program calculates the area of triangles formed by each combination of three points and then tries to find the maximum area by considering the absolute values of the areas.

To determine the correctness of the program, we can consider the following case:
Input:
```
4
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
0.5
```

In this case, the correct maximal area of the special quadrilateral formed by the given points is 0.5, but the program does not output this value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
