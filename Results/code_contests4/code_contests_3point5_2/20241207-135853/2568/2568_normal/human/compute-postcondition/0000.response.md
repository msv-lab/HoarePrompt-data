Example Answer:
The formula calculates the area of a triangle given its vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3). The variables x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 are taken from the input. After the calculation, the area of the triangle is stored in the variable 'area'. Therefore, the Output State is: area is the calculated area of the triangle.
Output State: **area is the calculated area of the triangle**
