The function `func_1` accepts 6 parameters: `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `y1`, `y2`, and `y3`, all of which are integers. The constraints for these parameters are that they must fall within the specified ranges. After executing the function body, the program calculates the area of the triangle formed by the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), and then returns half of that calculated area. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept 6 integer parameters representing coordinates of 3 points, calculate the area of the triangle formed by these points, and return half of that calculated area.
