Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the area of a triangle given three points. However, the problem description requires finding the maximal area of a special quadrilateral, not the area of a triangle. Additionally, the function `func_1` only accepts 3 points as input, whereas the problem description requires working with a set of n points to find the maximal area of a special quadrilateral.

Therefore, the annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
