Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The code calculates the maximal area of a special quadrilateral by iterating through all possible combinations of pairs of points and then checking the area of the triangle formed by the two points and each of the other points. This approach does not guarantee that the quadrilateral formed will have all four vertices in the set of special points. The code only checks the area of triangles formed by pairs of points, which may not necessarily lead to the formation of a special quadrilateral.

Additionally, the function `func_1` is defined to calculate the area of a triangle, but it contains a typo in the parameter names. It should have been `(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)` instead of `(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3)`. This typo leads to incorrect area calculations and affects the final result.

Therefore, the code does not correctly determine the maximal area of a special quadrilateral as per the problem description.
