Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not calculate the maximal area of a special quadrilateral as described in the problem. Instead, it calculates the area of a triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle given three points. The program is not designed to handle the problem of finding the maximal area of a special quadrilateral. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
