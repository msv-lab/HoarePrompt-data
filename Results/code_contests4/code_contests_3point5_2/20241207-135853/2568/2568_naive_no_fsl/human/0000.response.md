Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly calculates the maximal area of a special quadrilateral formed by the set of special points. The program iterates through all combinations of points to form quadrilaterals, calculates the area using the provided function `func_1`, and keeps track of the maximum area found. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and there are no evident cases where it does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
