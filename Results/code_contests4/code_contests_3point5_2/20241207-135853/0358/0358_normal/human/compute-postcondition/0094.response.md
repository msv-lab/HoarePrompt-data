Example Answer:
The value of `delta` is printed, and then `last` is incremented by 1. The value of `delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, nothing is printed. If `delta` is less than `n`, it is printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `last` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `last` is incremented by 1**
