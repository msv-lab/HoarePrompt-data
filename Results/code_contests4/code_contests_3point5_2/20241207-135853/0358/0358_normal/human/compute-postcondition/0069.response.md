Postcondition: ***`year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `now`, `logtime`, `last`, `n` are modified based on the loop's execution. The total seconds difference between `now` and each `x` in `logtime` has been printed. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program prints the substring of `line` from index 0 to `b`, and then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the variables.***
