Postcondition: ***`year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `now`, `logtime`, `last`, `n` have been modified according to the loop's execution. The total seconds difference between `now` and each `x` in `logtime` has been printed. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `last` is incremented by 1, and `n` is incremented by 1 as well. The loop continues to iterate until `delta` is less than `n`, at which point it breaks out of the loop. Additionally, the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`.***
