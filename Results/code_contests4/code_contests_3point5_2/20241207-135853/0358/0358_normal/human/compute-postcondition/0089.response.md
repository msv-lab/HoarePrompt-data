Example Answer:
`last` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `last` is unknown. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The difference in total seconds between `now` and `x` is calculated and stored in `delta` as an integer. If the value of `delta` is less than `n`, it is printed. `last` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **The difference in total seconds between `now` and `x` is calculated and stored in `delta` as an integer. If the value of `delta` is less than `n`, it is printed. `last` is incremented by 1**
