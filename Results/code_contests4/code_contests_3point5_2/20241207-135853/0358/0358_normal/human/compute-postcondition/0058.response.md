Postcondition: ***The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1. Additionally, in both cases, `last` is incremented by 1. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after updating `last`***
