Example Answer:
`delta` is assigned the value of the total seconds between `now` and `x`, converted to an integer. Based on the condition, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, nothing is printed. If `delta` is less than `n`, it is printed. In both cases, `last` is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, nothing is printed. If `delta` is less than `n`, it is printed. In both cases, `last` is incremented by 1.**
