Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the substring of `line` from the start to the index `a` (index of the first space character) into a list of integers after splitting it by '-'. These integers are assigned to `year`, `month`, and `day`. Since the initial values of variables are not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `year`, `month`, and `day`. Therefore, the Output State is: `year`, `month`, and `day` have been assigned values from the split substring of `line`.
Output State: **`year`, `month`, and `day` have been assigned values from the split substring of `line`**
