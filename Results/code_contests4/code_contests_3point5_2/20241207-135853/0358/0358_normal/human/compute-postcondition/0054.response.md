Example Answer: 
`delta` is assigned the total seconds difference between `now` and `x`. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1. The states of `now`, `x`, and `n` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1.
Output State: **The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1**
