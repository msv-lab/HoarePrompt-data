Example Answer:
The variable `delta` is assigned the value of the time difference between `now` and `x` in seconds. The value of `now` and `x` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `delta` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables retain their initial values described in the precondition.
Output State: **All variables retain their initial values described in the precondition**.
