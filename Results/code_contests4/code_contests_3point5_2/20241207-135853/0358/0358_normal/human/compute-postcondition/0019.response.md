Postcondition: ***logtime contains the datetime object now, last is either incremented by 1 or remains 0, line is the first element in the log list, a is the index of the first space in line, year, month, and day are assigned the integers obtained by splitting the substring of line before the first space using '-' as the delimiter, b is assigned the index of the last occurrence of ':' in line, hour, minute, and second are assigned the integers obtained by splitting the substring of line between indices a and b using ':' as the delimiter, logtime has elements starting from index last, x is the element at index last, delta is the difference in seconds between now and x as an integer, and the value of delta is printed. If delta is greater than or equal to n, variables are updated accordingly. Otherwise, if delta is less than n, no changes occur in the variables as we break out of the internal loop or if statement.***
