Example Answer:
The `now` datetime object is appended to the `logtime` list. The other variables `year`, `month`, `day`, and `b` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`year`, `month`, `day` are modified based on the string `line` up to the first space, `b` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`, `now` is assigned a datetime object with the provided values, `logtime` list now contains the `now` datetime object**
