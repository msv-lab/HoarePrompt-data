Example Answer: 
`last` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `last` is unknown, but after execution, `last` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `last` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `last` is incremented by 1**
