Postcondition: ***`delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `last` is incremented by 1. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program continues normally. Otherwise, `delta` is still an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and `x`, `last` is still incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
