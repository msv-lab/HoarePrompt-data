Postcondition: ***The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, `delta` contains the integer value of the difference. If `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n` and `last` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `n` and `last` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
