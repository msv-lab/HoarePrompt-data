Example Answer:
The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is calculated and stored in the variable `delta` as an integer. The other variables `n` and `last` are not affected by this calculation.
Output State: **The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, `delta` contains the integer value of the difference, `n` and `last` remain unchanged.**
