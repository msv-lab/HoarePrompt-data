Example Answer: 
The variable `a` is assigned the value of the index where the first space character is found in the string `line`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition, and `a` is assigned the index of the first space character in the string `line`.
Output State: **All variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition, `a` is assigned the index of the first space character in the string `line`**
