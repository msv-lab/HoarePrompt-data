Example Answer:
The value of `last` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `delta` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, `delta` contains the integer value of the difference, `n` and `last` are incremented by 1.
Output State: **The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, `delta` contains the integer value of the difference, `n` and `last` are incremented by 1**
