Postcondition: ***`delta` is an integer representing the total seconds between `now` and the last element in `logtime`, `last` is incremented by the number of elements in `logtime` after the `last` index. The program either continues normally if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n` or breaks out of the loop if `delta` is less than `n`. The length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`. The program prints the substring of `line` from the beginning up to index `b`.***
