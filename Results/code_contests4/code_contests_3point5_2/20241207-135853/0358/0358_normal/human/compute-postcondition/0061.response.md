Example Answer:
The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output. The value of `delta` contains the integer value of the difference, `n` and `last` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, `delta` contains the integer value of the difference, `n` and `last` remain unchanged.
Output State: **The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, `delta` contains the integer value of the difference, `n` and `last` remain unchanged.**
