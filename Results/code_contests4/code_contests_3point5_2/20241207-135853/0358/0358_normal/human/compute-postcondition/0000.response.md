Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `split()` splits the input based on whitespace. The values are then converted to integers using `int()`. However, since the initial state of the variables is not provided, the specific values of `n` and `m` cannot be determined.
Output State: **Specific values of `n` and `m` cannot be determined**
