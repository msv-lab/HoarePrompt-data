Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`. The values of `year`, `month`, and `day` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `year`, `month`, and `day` have been assigned values from the split substring of `line`; `b` is the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`.
Output State: **`year`, `month`, and `day` have been assigned values from the split substring of `line`; `b` is the index of the last occurrence of ':' in the string `line`**
