Example Answer:
`last` is increased by 1. The previous value of `last` is unknown, so after execution, `last` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1 and `last` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **The total seconds difference between `now` and `x` is printed as the output, if `delta` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `last` is increased by 1 and `last` is incremented by 1**
