Output State: **All variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition. The loop will continue iterating through the elements of logtime starting from index last. The value of delta will be calculated for each iteration and printed. If delta is greater than or equal to n, last will be incremented by 1. If delta is less than n, the loop will break. This process will continue until all elements in logtime have been processed. The length of logtime minus last is greater than or equal to m.**
