    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will iterate through all elements in the log list and perform the necessary calculations to update the variables `year`, `month`, `day`, `b`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `now`, `logtime`, `last`, `n`, and `m`. The loop will continue to calculate the total seconds difference between `now` and each element in `logtime`, incrementing `last` accordingly. If the length of `logtime` minus `last` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program will print the substring of `line` up to index `b` and break out of the loop. If the condition is not met, the program will print -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, processes the input log data, calculates time differences, and prints certain substrings based on specific conditions. It iterates through the log entries, calculates time differences, and prints out information based on those differences. The function does not accept any parameters and provides output based on the processed log data.
