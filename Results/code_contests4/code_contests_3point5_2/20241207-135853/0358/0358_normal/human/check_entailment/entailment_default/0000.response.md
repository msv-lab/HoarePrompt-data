Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. 
1. The code does not correctly handle the case when the number of warnings for the last n seconds is not less than m. It fails to update the 'last' index properly when the condition is met, leading to incorrect output.

Example:
Input
```
2 2
2012-03-16 23:59:59:Disk size is too sm
2012-03-17 00:00:00:Network failute dete
2012-03-17 00:00:01:Cant write varlogmysq
```
Output
```
2012-03-17 00:00
```
Expected Output
```
2012-03-17 00:00:00
```

The code does not handle this case correctly, therefore the Correctness is **False**.
