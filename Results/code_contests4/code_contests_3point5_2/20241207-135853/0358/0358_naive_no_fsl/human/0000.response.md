Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

1. The program reads the input correctly by taking the values of n and m as integers and reading the log stream from the standard input.
2. It correctly extracts the date and time information from each log entry and calculates the time difference between the current log entry and the previous log entries.
3. The program correctly checks if the number of warnings for the last n seconds is not less than m by iterating through the log entries and updating the 'last' variable accordingly.
4. It outputs the first moment of time when the condition is met or -1 if there is no such moment.
5. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that it correctly identifies the first moment when the number of warnings for the last n seconds is not less than m.
