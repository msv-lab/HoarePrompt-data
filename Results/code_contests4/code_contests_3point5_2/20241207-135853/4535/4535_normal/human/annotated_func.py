#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10100000.**
def func_1(x):
    return int(str(x)[::-1])
    #The program returns the integer x reversed as a string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer x and returns the reversed form of x as a string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10100000.**
def func_2(x):
    return x + func_1(x)
    #The program returns the positive integer x added to the result of func_1(x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts a positive integer x, adds x to the result of func_1(x), and returns the sum of x and func_1(x). The function relies on func_1(x) being defined elsewhere to compute the final result.
