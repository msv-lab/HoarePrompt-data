Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(x)`: This function takes a positive integer `x` and returns the integer `x` reversed as a string. This aligns with the requirement of flipping the number.
2. `func_2(x)`: This function takes a positive integer `x`, calls `func_1(x)` to get the reversed number, and then adds it to `x`. This aligns with the requirement of finding a number `a` such that `a + ar = n`.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description as it correctly implements the required logic for finding a suitable value of `a` given `n`.
