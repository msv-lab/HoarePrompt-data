Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions func_1 and func_2 which correctly implement the flipping operation and the sum of a number and its flipped version as described in the problem description.
2. The functions take a positive integer x as input and return the expected results without leading zeroes.
3. The functions cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the provided examples, ensuring that the output is correct.
