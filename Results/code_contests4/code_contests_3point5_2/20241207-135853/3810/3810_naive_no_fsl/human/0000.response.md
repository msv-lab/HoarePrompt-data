Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input for the number of universities and each university's donation amount, minimum denomination, and maximum denomination.
2. It then iterates through each university and checks if it is possible to pay the donation amount using coins with denomination from the specified range.
3. The program uses binary search to find the minimum number of coins needed to pay the donation amount within the specified range.
4. Finally, it prints "Yes" if it is possible to pay the donation amount, otherwise it prints "No".

The program follows the problem description and correctly determines if Alexey can enter a university based on the given constraints. The logic implemented in the program covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
