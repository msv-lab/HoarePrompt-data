Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads the number of universities and their corresponding donation amounts and limits for coin denominations. It then iterates through each university and checks if it is possible to gather the required donation amount using coins within the specified denomination limits. The program uses binary search to efficiently determine if the donation amount can be achieved. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, it is correct.
