Example Answer:
The value of `at_start` is set to `False`, which means the program is not at the start. This does not affect the values of `sep` and `file`, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` have specific values, `at_start` is False.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` have specific values, `at_start` is False**
