According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value returned by `func_1()`. If the value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:

- `n`, `l`, and `r` retain the values returned by `func_3()`
- `f` remains 1
- The loop has been executed at least once with the value returned by `func_1()` being greater than 0
- `low` will be greater than `high`
- `mid` will be the last value calculated before the loop stops
- `x` will be the result of `l` multiplied by the last `mid` value
- `y` will be the result of `r` multiplied by the last `mid` value
- The final values of `x` and `y` will still hold the relationship `x <= n` and `n <= y`
- If `f` is true, the program remains in the same state after executing `func_20('Yes')`, else if `f` is false, the program remains in the same state after executing `func_20('No')`, and no variables are affected by the function call.

To execute the loop one more time, the value returned by `func_1()` must still be greater than 0.
State: **After the execution of the loop, the program state remains the same with the value returned by `func_1()` being greater than 0**
