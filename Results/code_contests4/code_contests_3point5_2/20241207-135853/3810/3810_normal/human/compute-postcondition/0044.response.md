According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value returned by `func_1()`. If the returned value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` are determined by `func_3()` and the condition `l * mid <= n <= r * mid` is satisfied with `f` being 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0**
