According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are described as follows:
- `n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0
- `low` is either `mid + 1` or `1`
- `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999
- `f` is 1
- `mid` is the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2
- `x` is the product of `l` and `mid`
- `y` is the product of `r` and `mid`
- either `y` is less than `n` or `y` is greater than or equal to `n`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `low` should be adjusted to be less than or equal to `high`
- `x` should be assigned the value of `l * mid`
- `y` should be assigned the value of `r * mid`
- In the if block, `low` should be assigned the value of `mid + 1`
- In the else block, `high` should be decreased by 1

State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is assigned `r * mid`; either `y` is less than `n` or `y` is greater than or equal to `n`**
