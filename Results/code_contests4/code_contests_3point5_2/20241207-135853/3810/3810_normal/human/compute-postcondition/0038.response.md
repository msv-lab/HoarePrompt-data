Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `r` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`. If there exists a value of `mid` such that `l * mid` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `r * mid`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0. The final values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` depend on the last iteration of the loop.**
