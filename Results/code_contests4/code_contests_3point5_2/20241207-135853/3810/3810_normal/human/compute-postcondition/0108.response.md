Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is either `mid + 1` or `1`; `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999; `f` is 1; `mid` is the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2; `x` is the product of `l` and `mid`; `y` is the product of `r` and `mid`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. After the execution of the if else block, the program state is such that either `y` is less than `n` or `y` is greater than or equal to `n`. To execute the loop again, `low` should be adjusted to be less than or equal to `high; `x` is assigned the value `l * mid`.**
