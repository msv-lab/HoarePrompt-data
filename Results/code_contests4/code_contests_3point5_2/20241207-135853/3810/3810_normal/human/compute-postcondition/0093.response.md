According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 1 and `high` is 1000000000. So, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `low` should be less than `high`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `l`, and `r` are greater than 0; `low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 0**
