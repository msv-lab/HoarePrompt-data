Postcondition: ***`sep` and `file` have specific values, `at_start` is False, all elements in `args` have been written as strings to the file specified by `file`. The `kwargs` dictionary pops the value associated with the key 'end' and writes it to the file. If the 'flush' key with a value of False is present in `kwargs`, then it is popped from the dictionary.***
