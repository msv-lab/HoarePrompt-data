Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` are values returned by `func_3()`. If there exists a value of `mid` such that `l * mid` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `r * mid`, then `f` is 1 and the final values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` are determined by the last iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `f` remains 0. The final values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `f`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
