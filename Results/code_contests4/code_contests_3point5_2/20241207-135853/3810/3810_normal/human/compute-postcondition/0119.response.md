Example Answer:
`y` is assigned the value `r * mid`. The value of `r` and `mid` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is either less than `n` or greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is either less than `n` or greater than or equal to `n`**
