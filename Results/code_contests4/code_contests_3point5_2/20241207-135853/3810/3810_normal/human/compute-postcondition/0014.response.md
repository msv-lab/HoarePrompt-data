According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If there are more elements in the `args` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` and `file` have specific values, and `at_start` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the `args` list must have more elements, and the loop will iterate over the next element in the list.
State: **`sep` and `file` have specific values, `at_start` is False, for the loop to execute one more time `args` list must have more elements**
