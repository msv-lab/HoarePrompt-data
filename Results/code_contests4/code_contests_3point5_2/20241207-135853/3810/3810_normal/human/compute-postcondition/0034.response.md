Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r`, `y`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `f` remain the same as their previous values. For the loop to execute again, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `x` is assigned the value of `l` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`. If `x` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then `f` is set to 1 and the loop or if statement is terminated.***
