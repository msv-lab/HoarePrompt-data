According to the code, the loop can execute if the `args` list has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, `sep` and `file` are assigned values from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` respectively. `at_start` is True does not guarantee the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `args` has at least 1 element, `sep` and `file` have values assigned from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` respectively, and `at_start` is True.
State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned values retrieved from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout), respectively; `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute `args` has at least 1 element**
