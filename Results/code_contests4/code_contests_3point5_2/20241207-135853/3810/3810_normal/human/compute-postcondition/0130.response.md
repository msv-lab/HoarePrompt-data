Output State: **'n', 'l', 'r' are greater than 0; 'low' is greater than or equal to 'high'; 'f' is 0 if the condition is not met, 1 otherwise; 'mid' is the value that satisfies the conditions in the loop; 'x' is the product of 'l' and 'mid'; 'y' is the product of 'r' and 'mid'. The loop terminates when 'low' becomes greater than 'high' or when the condition 'x <= n and n <= y' is met.**
