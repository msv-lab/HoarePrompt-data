Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low` and `high` are not specified, so the value of `mid` will depend on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `r`, `y`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `f` remain the same as their previous values, for the loop to execute again `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `y`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `f` remain the same as their previous values, for the loop to execute again `low` is less than or equal to `high`**
