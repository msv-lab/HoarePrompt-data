Output State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned values retrieved from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` respectively. If `at_start` is False and `args` has at least 1 element, then the program remains unchanged from its initial state. After executing `file.write(str(x))`, the content of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file specified by `file`.**
