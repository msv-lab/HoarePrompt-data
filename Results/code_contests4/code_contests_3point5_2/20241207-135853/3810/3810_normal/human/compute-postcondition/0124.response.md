Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is either less than `n` or greater than or equal to `n`; `f` is assigned the value 1; `high` is now assigned `mid - 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
