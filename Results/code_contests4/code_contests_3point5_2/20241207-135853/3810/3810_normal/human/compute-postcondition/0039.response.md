Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`. If there exists a value of `mid` such that `l * mid` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to `r * mid`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, `f` remains 0. Also, after entering the if condition `(f)`, the final state of the program variables `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, and `y` is determined by the last iteration of the loop.***
