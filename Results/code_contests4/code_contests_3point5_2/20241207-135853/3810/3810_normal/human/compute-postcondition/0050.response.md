Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The values of `low` and `high` are given as 1 and 1000000000 respectively. Therefore, `mid` would be (1 + 1000000000) // 2 which equals 500000000. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0, `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000**
