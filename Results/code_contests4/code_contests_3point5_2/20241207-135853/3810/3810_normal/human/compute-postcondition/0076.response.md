Output State: **After the if else block executes, `n`, `l`, `r` retain the values returned by `func_3()`, `f` remains 1, the loop has been executed at least once with the value returned by `func_1()` being greater than 0, `low` retains either `mid + 1` or 1 based on the condition, `high` retains either 1000000000 or 499999999 based on the condition, `mid` maintains the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l` multiplied by `mid`, and `y` is the result of `r` multiplied by `mid`. Additionally, `x` remains less than or equal to `n`, and `n` remains less than or equal to `y`. If `y` < `n`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. `x` is calculated as `l * mid`. `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`.**
