Example Answer: 
`sep` and `file` are assigned values retrieved from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` respectively. Since `at_start` is False and `args` has at least 1 element, the program remains unchanged from its initial state. After executing `file.write(str(x))`, the content of `x` is converted to a string and written to the file specified by `file`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` and `file` are assigned values retrieved from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, program remains unchanged, content of `x` is written as a string to the file specified by `file`.
Output State: **`sep` and `file` are assigned values retrieved from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, program remains unchanged, content of `x` is written as a string to the file specified by `file`**
