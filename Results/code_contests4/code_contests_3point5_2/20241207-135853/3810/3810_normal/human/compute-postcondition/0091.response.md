Example Answer:
`high` is assigned the value 1000000000. The previous values of `n`, `l`, `r`, and `low` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, and `r` are greater than 0; `low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `r` are greater than 0; `low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000**
