According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all other variables remain the same as their previous values. So, for the loop to execute one more time, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `l`, `r`, `y`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `x`, `f` remain the same as their previous values, for the loop to execute again `low` is less than or equal to `high`**
