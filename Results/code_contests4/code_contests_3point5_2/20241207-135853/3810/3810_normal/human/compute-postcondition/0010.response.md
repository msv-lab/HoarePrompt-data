Example Answer:
`sep` is assigned the value retrieved from `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which means it will either have the value passed in the `kwargs` dictionary or the default value of space. `file` is assigned the value retrieved from `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which means it will either have the value passed in the `kwargs` dictionary or the default value of `sys.stdout`. The `write` method is called on `file` with the value of `sep`, which will be written to the file specified by `file`. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` has a specific value, `file` has a specific value, and the content of the next element in `args` is written as a string to the file specified by `file`.
Output State: **`sep` has a specific value, `file` has a specific value, content of the next element in `args` is written as a string to the file specified by `file`**
