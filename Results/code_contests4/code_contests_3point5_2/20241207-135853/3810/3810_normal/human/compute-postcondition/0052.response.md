Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0, `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is the result of `l` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is the result of `r` multiplied by `mid`.**
