ou have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the while loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the while loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.

Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1
Code of the loop:
```
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 times: `factorial` is `n`, `n` is decremented to `n-1`.
Output State after loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1)`, `n` is decremented to `n-2`, initial `n` had greater than 1
Output State after loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)`, `n` is decremented to `n-3`, initial `n` had greater than 2.
Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
if n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and fac will contain the factorial of n and n will be 0. If n is 0 then the loop wont execute and fac will remain 1, which is indeed the factorial of 0 , and the value of n wont change.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `fac` is the factorial of the original value of `n`, 'n' is 0.
Output State: **n` is 0, `fac` is the factorial of the original value of 'n' **

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0, 'students' can hold any value. 
Code of the loop:
```
while students >= 1:
    total += students
    students -= 1
```

Output state after loop executes 1 time: `total` is equal to the initial value of 'students', 'students' becomes 1 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to twice the initial value of 'students' minus 1, 'students' becomes 2 less than the initial value of 'students'
Output state after loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to three times the initial value of 'students' minus 3, 'students' becomes 3 less than the initial value of 'students'

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to students and stores it in total . The loop will be executed at least once if students is greater or equal to 1 and in the end students will be 0. if students is less thn 1 then the loop will not execute and the value of total will remain 0.
Output State: **'students' is 0, if students was initially greater or equal to 1 then total` is the sum of all numbers from 1 to the initial value of students, if students is less than 1 the loop doesnt execute and total is 0**
Your Task:

Initial State: `n`, `l`, and `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0, `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000
Code of the loop:
```
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    x = l * mid
    y = r * mid
    if x <= n and n <= y:
        f = 1
        break
    if y < n:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1

```

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 1, the loop executed at least once with the value returned by `func_1()` greater than 0, `low` is either `mid + 1` or 1 based on the condition, `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999 based on the condition, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is the result of `l` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is the result of `r` multiplied by `mid`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `y` is less than `n`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains the same. If `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `low` remains 1 and `high` is updated to 499999999.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *After the if else block executes, `n`, `l`, `r` retain the values returned by `func_3()`, `f` remains 1, the loop has been executed at least once with the value returned by `func_1()` being greater than 0, `low` retains either `mid + 1` or 1 based on the condition, `high` retains either 1000000000 or 499999999 based on the condition, `mid` maintains the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l` multiplied by `mid`, and `y` is the result of `r` multiplied by `mid`. Additionally, `x` remains less than or equal to `n`, and `n` remains less than or equal to `y`. Lastly, if the loop or if statement is exited, `x` is assigned the value of `l` multiplied by `mid`, and `y` is assigned the value of `r` multiplied by `mid`. If `y` < `n`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1` and all other variables retain their values as stated above.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *After the execution of the if else block, the values of `n`, `l`, `r` remain the same as those returned by `func_3()`, `f` remains 1, the loop has been executed at least once with the value returned by `func_1()` being greater than 0, `low` retains either `mid + 1` or 1 based on the condition, `high` retains either 1000000000 or 499999999 based on the condition, `mid` maintains the result of `(low + high) // 2`, `x` is the result of `l` multiplied by `mid`, and `y` is the result of `r` multiplied by `mid`. Additionally, `x` remains less than or equal to `n`, and `n` remains less than or equal to `y`. If `y` is less than `n`, `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, `x` is calculated as `l * mid`, and `y` is assigned the value of `r * mid`. If `y` is not less than `n`, `low` remains `mid + 1` and `x` and `y` remain the same.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example, determine the loop's output state, after all the iterations of the loop have executed. Make sure to include the values of the variables after the loop has finished especially the any loop control variables. 
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
