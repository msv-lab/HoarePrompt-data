According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `low` and `high`. If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000. No adjustments are needed for `low` and `high` as they already satisfy the condition. 
Additionally, `n`, `l`, and `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, and `f` is 0. The value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the value returned by `func_1()` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
State: **`n`, `l`, and `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0, `low` is 1, `high` is 1000000000**
