Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is either less than `n` or greater than or equal to `n`; `f` is assigned the value 1. If `y` is less than `n`, `low` is assigned `mid + 1`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, `high` is assigned `mid - 1`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after either condition is met.***
