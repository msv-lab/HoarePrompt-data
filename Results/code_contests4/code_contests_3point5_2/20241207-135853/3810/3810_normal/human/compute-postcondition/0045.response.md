Example Answer:
`n`, `l`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. The specific values returned by `func_3()` are unknown, but they are stored in the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, and `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time the value returned by `func_1()` must be greater than 0**
