Example Answer:
`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` are not specified, but `low` is less than or equal to `high`, so `mid` is the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is assigned `r * mid`; either `y` is less than `n` or `y` is greater than or equal to `n` and `mid` is calculated based on the formula mentioned.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is assigned `r * mid`; either `y` is less than `n` or `y` is greater than or equal to `n` and `mid` is calculated based on the formula mentioned.**
