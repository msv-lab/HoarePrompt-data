Output State: **After the loop executes, `n`, `l`, and `r` retain the values returned by `func_3()`, `f` remains 1, the loop has been executed at least once with the value returned by `func_1()` being greater than 0, `low` will be greater than `high`, `mid` will be the last value calculated before the loop stops, `x` will be the result of `l` multiplied by the last `mid` value, `y` will be the result of `r` multiplied by the last `mid` value. The final values of `x` and `y` will still hold the relationship `x <= n` and `n <= y`.**
