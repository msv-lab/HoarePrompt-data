Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, 'n', 'l', 'r' are greater than 0; 'low' is greater than high; 'mid' is the value that satisfies the conditions in the loop; 'x' is the product of 'l' and 'mid'; 'y' is the product of 'r' and 'mid'. The loop will terminate when 'low' becomes greater than 'high' or when the condition 'x <= n and n <= y' is met. If 'f' is true, the program will execute the if part with the given conditions. If 'f' is false, the program will execute the else part with the same conditions.**
