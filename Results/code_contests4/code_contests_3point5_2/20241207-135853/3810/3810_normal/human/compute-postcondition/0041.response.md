Postcondition: ***n, l, and r are assigned values returned by func_3(). If there does not exist a value of mid such that l * mid is less than or equal to n and n is less than or equal to r * mid, then f remains 0. The final values of low, high, mid, x, and y depend on the last iteration of the loop.***
