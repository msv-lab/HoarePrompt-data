Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is 1; `high` is 1000000000; `f` is 1; `mid` is 500000000; `x` is the product of `l` and `mid`; `y` is the product of `r` and `mid`; if `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
