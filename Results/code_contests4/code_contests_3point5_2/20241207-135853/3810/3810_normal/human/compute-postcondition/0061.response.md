Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `r` are values returned by `func_3()`, `f` is 1, the loop executed at least once with the value returned by `func_1()` greater than 0, `low` is either `mid + 1` or 1 based on the condition, `high` is either 1000000000 or 499999999 based on the condition, `mid` is 500000000, `x` is the result of `l` multiplied by `mid`, `y` is the result of `r` multiplied by `mid`, `x` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is less than or equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `y` is less than `n`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1` and `high` remains the same. If `y` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `low` remains 1 and `high` is updated to 499999999.***
