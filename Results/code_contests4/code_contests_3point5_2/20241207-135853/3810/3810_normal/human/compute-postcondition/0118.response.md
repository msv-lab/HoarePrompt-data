Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `l` multiplied by `mid`, where `mid` is calculated based on a formula not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is assigned `r * mid`; either `y` is less than `n` or `y` is greater than or equal to `n` and `mid` is calculated based on the formula mentioned.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `r` are greater than 0; `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `x` is assigned `l * mid`; `y` is assigned `r * mid`; either `y` is less than `n` or `y` is greater than or equal to `n` and `mid` is calculated based on the formula mentioned**
