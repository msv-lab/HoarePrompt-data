The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It initializes the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread with the `main` function as the target, and starts the thread. The function does not explicitly return any value, and its purpose seems to be to initiate a parallel task using threading. The actual computations and results are expected to be handled within the `main` function that is being targeted by the thread. The annotations provide preconditions regarding the values of variables `t`, `ni`, `li`, and `ri`, but the function itself does not perform any significant calculations or return specific results based on these constraints.
