The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of universities. `m` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three positive integers ni, li, ri (1 <= ni, li, ri <= 10^9) where li <= ri. `num` is not used in the program. The function creates a 2D list where each row represents a university and contains 'm' tuples, each tuple consisting of three positive integers ni, li, ri (1 <= ni, li, ri <= 10^9) where li <= ri.
