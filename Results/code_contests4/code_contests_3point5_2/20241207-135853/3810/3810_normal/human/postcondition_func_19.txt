The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters and writes the elements in `args` to a specified file with a separator `sep`. It then writes the value associated with the key 'end' in the `kwargs` dictionary to the file. If the key 'flush' with a value of False exists in `kwargs`, it flushes the file. The function does not return any value.
