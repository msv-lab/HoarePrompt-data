The function `func_15` accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p` within the specified constraints. The parameter `y` is initially set to 0. The function then performs a series of modulo, multiplication, and bitwise operations inside a loop to update the value of `res`. Finally, it returns the final value of `res` after the loop has been executed. The function iterates through the loop based on the conditions met during the execution, updating `res` accordingly.
