Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code consists of functions that handle input parsing, calculation, and output printing based on the problem description. 
- The functions appear to be correctly implemented to handle the given constraints of the problem.
- The main function `func_19` iterates through each query and determines whether Alexey can enter the university based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
- The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and scenarios described in the problem statement.
- The annotations provide insights into the functionality of each function, and based on the code and annotations, it seems that the program adheres to the problem description for every potential case.
- Since no specific case of failure or discrepancy has been identified, the code is considered correct.
