Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines functions that handle the input, process the data according to the problem description, and output the results. The function func_19 uses binary search to efficiently find if it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri berubleys. The program correctly handles the input constraints and implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

The functions are appropriately defined with precondition comments that specify the input conditions. The functions perform the required calculations and comparisons to determine if Alexey can enter a university based on the given donation constraints.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for each query, making it correct.
