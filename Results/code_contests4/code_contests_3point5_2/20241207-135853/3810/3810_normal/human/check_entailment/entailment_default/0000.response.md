Based on the analysis of the provided code and the problem description, as well as considering the output hints, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the number of universities `t` and then iterates through each university to check if Alexey can pay the required donation within the specified coin denominations range. It uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently determine if the donation can be paid.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description, where Alexey needs to pay a specific amount within the coin denominations provided by each university.
- The output format also matches the expected output of "Yes" if Alexey can enter the university and "No" otherwise.
- The functions defined in the code handle input reading, binary search, and output printing efficiently.
- The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement without any edge cases where it fails to meet the requirements.
