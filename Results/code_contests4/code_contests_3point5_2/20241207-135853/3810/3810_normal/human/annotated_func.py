    #The program returns an integer obtained from user input
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns the integer obtained from the user input. The functionality of the function is to return an integer obtained from user input. The function lacks error handling for cases where the input is not an integer.

    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input string by space and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the console, splits the input string by space, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The code does not specify how the input is structured or what the map object will be used for further. Edge cases such as handling invalid input or empty input are not addressed in the annotations.

    #The program returns a map object containing the string representations of the input values after splitting them by space.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It reads an input line, splits it by space, converts each element to a string, and returns a map object containing these string representations. The code does not handle the processing of t requests containing three integers ni, li, ri as described in the annotations. Additionally, the function does not impose any restrictions on the input format or handle any edge cases related to the input values.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It initializes the recursion limit and stack size, creates a new thread with the `main` function as the target, and starts the thread. The function does not explicitly return any value, and its purpose seems to be to initiate a parallel task using threading. The actual computations and results are expected to be handled within the `main` function that is being targeted by the thread. The annotations provide preconditions regarding the values of variables `t`, `ni`, `li`, and `ri`, but the function itself does not perform any significant calculations or return specific results based on these constraints.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of universities. `m` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three positive integers ni, li, ri (1 <= ni, li, ri <= 10^9) where li <= ri. `num` is not used in the program. The function creates a 2D list where each row represents a university and contains 'm' tuples, each tuple consisting of three positive integers ni, li, ri (1 <= ni, li, ri <= 10^9) where li <= ri.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_10 accepts a positive integer `x` and returns the result of performing a bitwise operation on x and not x & x - 1. The function checks if x is a power of 2 by performing a bitwise operation and returns True if x is a power of 2, otherwise it returns False.

def func_11(n):

    #The program returns the binary representation of the integer n after removing the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns its binary representation after removing the '0b' prefix. The function does not specify any conditions related to the values of `ni`, `li`, and `ri` mentioned in the annotations. It solely focuses on converting `n` to binary format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**:

    else :

        #The program returns the result of dividing x by y, rounding up to the nearest integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It checks if `x` is divisible by `y`. If it is divisible, it returns the integer value of the division. If it is not divisible, it returns the result of dividing `x` by `y` and rounding up to the nearest integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts three integer parameters `x`, `y`, and `p` within the specified constraints. The parameter `y` is initially set to 0. The function then performs a series of modulo, multiplication, and bitwise operations inside a loop to update the value of `res`. Finally, it returns the final value of `res` after the loop has been executed. The function iterates through the loop based on the conditions met during the execution, updating `res` accordingly.

    #The program returns the result of the modulo operation of the original 'x' and 'y', where 'y' is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_16 accepts two parameters x and y, swaps their values iteratively until y becomes 0, and then returns the result of the modulo operation of the original x and y, where y is 0. The function essentially implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of x and y.

The loop will terminate when 'low' becomes greater than 'high' or when the condition 'x <= n and n <= y' is met. If 'f' is true, the program will execute the if part with the given conditions. If 'f' is false, the program will execute the else part with the same conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters and iterates a loop multiple times. Within each iteration, it calculates whether a given condition is satisfied based on the values of `n`, `l`, and `r`.
