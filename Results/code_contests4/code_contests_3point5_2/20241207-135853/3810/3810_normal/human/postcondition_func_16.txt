The function `func_17` accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and True otherwise after checking for divisibility by numbers starting from 5 in increments of 6 until reaching the square root of `n`.
