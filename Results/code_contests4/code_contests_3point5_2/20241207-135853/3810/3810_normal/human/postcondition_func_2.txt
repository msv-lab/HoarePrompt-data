The function func_3 does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the console, splits the input string by space, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The code does not specify how the input is structured or what the map object will be used for further. Edge cases such as handling invalid input or empty input are not addressed in the annotations.
