The function func_4 does not accept any parameters. It reads an input line, splits it by space, converts each element to a string, and returns a map object containing these string representations. The code does not handle the processing of t requests containing three integers ni, li, ri as described in the annotations. Additionally, the function does not impose any restrictions on the input format or handle any edge cases related to the input values.
