You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Bike loves looking for the second maximum element in the sequence. The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbers x1, x2, ..., xk (k > 1) is such maximum element xj, that the following inequality holds: <image>.

The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers x1, x2, ..., xk (k > 1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence.

You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers s1, s2, ..., sn (n > 1). Let's denote sequence sl, sl + 1, ..., sr as s[l..r] (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r].

Note that as all numbers in sequence s are distinct, all the given definitions make sence.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 < n ≤ 105). The second line contains n distinct integers s1, s2, ..., sn (1 ≤ si ≤ 109).

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r].

Examples

Input

5
5 2 1 4 3


Output

7


Input

5
9 8 3 5 7


Output

15

Note

For the first sample you can choose s[4..5] = {4, 3} and its lucky number is (4 xor 3) = 7. You can also choose s[1..2].

For the second sample you must choose s[2..5] = {8, 3, 5, 7}.
