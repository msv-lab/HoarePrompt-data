    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` is a non-empty list with elements removed such that the last element is greater than or equal to all subsequent elements in `a`, `ans` is the maximum value obtained from XOR operations between the last two elements of `stack` throughout the loop execution, `a` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is the last element of `a` appended to `stack`
    return ans
    #The program returns the maximum value obtained from XOR operations between the last two elements of 'stack' throughout the loop execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a`, iterates through its elements, maintains a stack where elements are added and removed based on specific conditions, calculates the XOR operation between the last two elements of the stack, and returns the maximum XOR value obtained during the iterations.
