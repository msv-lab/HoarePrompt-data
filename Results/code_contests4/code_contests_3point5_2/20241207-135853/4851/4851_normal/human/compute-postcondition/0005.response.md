Example Answer:
The last element of the `stack` list is removed using the `pop()` method. Since the initial state mentions that `stack` has at least 2 elements, after executing `stack.pop()`, the `stack` list will have one less element than before. The value of `ans` remains 0, `a` is still a non-empty iterable, and `i` remains the first element of `a`.
Output State: **`stack` is a list with at least 1 element, `ans` is 0, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element of `a`**
