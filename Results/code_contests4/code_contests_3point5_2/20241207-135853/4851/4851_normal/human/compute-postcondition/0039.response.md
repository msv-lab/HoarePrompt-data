The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is expected to be a list named 'stack'. The program returns the maximum value obtained from XOR operations between the last two elements of 'stack' throughout the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list 'stack' and return the maximum value obtained from XOR operations between the last two elements of 'stack' during the loop execution.
