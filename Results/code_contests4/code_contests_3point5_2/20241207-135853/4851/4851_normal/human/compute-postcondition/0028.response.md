According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stack and the last element of the stack in comparison to `i`. If the last element of the stack is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the stack is a non-empty list with elements removed such that the last element is greater than or equal to `i`, `a` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `a`, and `stack` has `i` appended to it. For the loop to execute one more time, the last element of the stack needs to be less than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` is a non-empty list with elements removed such that the last element is greater than or equal to the next `i`, `a` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `a`, `stack` has `i` appended to it, and for the loop to execute again, the last element of `stack` is less than `i`**
