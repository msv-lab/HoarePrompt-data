According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `stack` and `i`. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `stack` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `a`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `stack` needs to be a non-empty list and `i` should be greater than the last element of `stack`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` is a non-empty list, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element of `a`**
