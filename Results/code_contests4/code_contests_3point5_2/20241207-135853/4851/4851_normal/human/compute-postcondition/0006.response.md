According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `stack` and `i`. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the last element of `stack` needs to be less than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` is a list with at least 1 element, `ans` is 0, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element of `a`, for the loop to execute again the last element of `stack` is less than `i`**
