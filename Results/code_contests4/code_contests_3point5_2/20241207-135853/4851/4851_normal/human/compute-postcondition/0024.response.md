Postcondition: ***`stack` is a non-empty list with elements removed such that the last element is less than or equal to the next `i` and the next element in `a`, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of the XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `a` and `stack` has `i` appended to it. Additionally, the length of `stack` is greater than 1.***
