According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `stack` and `i`. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` is a list with one less element. For the loop to execute one more time, `stack` should have at least 2 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`stack` is a list with at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element of `a`**
