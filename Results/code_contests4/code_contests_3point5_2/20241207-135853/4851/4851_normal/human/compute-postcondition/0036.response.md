Postcondition: ***`stack` is a non-empty list with elements removed such that the last element is greater than or equal to the next `i`, `a` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `a`, `stack` has `i` and the appended value of `i`, and the length of `stack` is greater than 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the XOR operation of the last two elements of `stack`***
