Postcondition: ***`stack` is a list with elements removed such that the last element is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the current `ans` and the result of the XOR operation between the last two elements of `stack`, `a` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `stack` is appended with `i`. If the length of `stack` is greater than 1, the function executes the described operations.***
