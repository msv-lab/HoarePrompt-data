Example Answer:
`nn[d]` is assigned the value `j`. After the execution, `nn[d]` will have the same value as `j`, but the initial values of `j` and `d` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution, `cell[d]` is set to True; `core[j]` is assigned the value `i + 1`; `core[nn[d]]` is also assigned the value `i + 1`.
Output State: **After the execution, `cell[d]` is set to True; `core[j]` is assigned the value `i + 1`; `core[nn[d]]` is also assigned the value `i + 1**
