Example Answer:
`nn` is assigned a list of `0` values with a length of `k + 1`. Since `k` ranges from 1 to 100, `nn` will be a list of `0` values with a length ranging from 1 to 101. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100; `ins` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0; `cell` is a list of `False` values with a length ranging from 2 to 101; `nn` is a list of `0` values with a length ranging from 1 to 101.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100; `ins` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0; `cell` is a list of `False` values with a length ranging from 2 to 101; `nn` is a list of `0` values with a length ranging from 1 to 101**
