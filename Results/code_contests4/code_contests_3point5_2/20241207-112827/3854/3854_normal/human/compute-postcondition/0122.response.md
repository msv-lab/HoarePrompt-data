Example Answer: 
`nn[j]` is assigned the value 0. The loop will execute another time, so `nn[j]` will remain 0. The values of `k` and `j` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nn[j]` is 0.
Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nn[j]` is 0**
