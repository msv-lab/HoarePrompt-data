According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n + 2`, and for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `k`. 
State: **`k` is greater than 1, all elements in `nn` are adjusted, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `n + 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[n][i+1]`, `core[n]` is assigned the value of `i + 2` for the loop to execute one more time, `nn[j]` is 0**
