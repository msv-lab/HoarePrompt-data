Postcondition: ***`k` is adjusted such that `k + 1` is within the range of 1 to n, `j` is incremented to the next value within the range for the loop to execute one more time, `core[j]` is equal to 0, `d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, and `d` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the condition (cell[d]) is false. Moreover, `nn[d]` is not equal to 0***
