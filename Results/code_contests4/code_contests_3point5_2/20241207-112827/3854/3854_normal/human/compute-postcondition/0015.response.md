According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, value of `nn[j]` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` should still be less than or equal to `k`.
State: **`k` is greater than 0, value of `nn[j]` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be incremented by 1 and `j` should be less than or equal to `k`**
