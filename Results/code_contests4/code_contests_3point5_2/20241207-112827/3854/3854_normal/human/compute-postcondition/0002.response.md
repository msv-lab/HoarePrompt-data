The list `cell` is initialized as a list of `False` values with a length of `k + 1`. Since the values of `k` can range from 1 to 100, the length of the `cell` list will range from 2 to 101. The values of other variables (`n`, `m`, and `ins`) are not affected by this initialization.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100; `ins` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0; `cell` is a list of `False` values with a length ranging from 2 to 101**
