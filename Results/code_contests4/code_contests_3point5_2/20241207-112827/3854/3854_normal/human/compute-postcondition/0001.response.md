Example Answer:
A 2D list `ins` is created with dimensions (n+1) x m, where each element is initialized to 0. Given that n, m, and k are integers between 1 and 100, the dimensions of the list will be between 2x1 and 101x100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100; `ins` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100; `ins` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x m initialized with 0**
