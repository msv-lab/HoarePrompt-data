Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `k`, `j + 1`, `core[j + 1]`, `d = ins[j + 1][i]`, `ins[j + 1][i]`, and `nn[d]` are appropriately updated based on the conditions of the program. If `cell[d]` is True, then `core[j]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is set to True, `core[j]` is assigned the value `i + 1`, and `core[nn[d]]` is also assigned the value `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value `j`.***
