Postcondition: ***`k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater or equal to 1, `j` is 1. If `core[j]` is equal to 0, then `core[j]` is equal to i + 1 if `nn[d]` is not 0, otherwise `core[j]` is equal to 0. `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `nn[d]` is j if `nn[d]` is not 0, otherwise `nn[d]` is 0.***
