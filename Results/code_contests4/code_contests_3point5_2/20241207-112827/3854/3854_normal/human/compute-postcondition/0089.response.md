Postcondition: ***`k`, `j`, `core[j]`, `d`, `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]`, and `nn[d]` are all appropriately updated based on the conditions of the program. If `d` is not equal to 0, `k` is adjusted such that `k + 1` is within the range of 1 to n, `j` is incremented to the next value within the range for the loop to execute one more time, `core[j]` is equal to `i + 1`, `d` is assigned the value `ins[j][i]`, and `d` is not equal to 0. If the condition `(cell[d])` is true, then `core[j]` is updated to `i + 1`. If the condition `(cell[d])` is false, then `core[j]` remains 0. Additionally, if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is updated to `j`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, `core[j]` remains 0, and `nn[d]` is updated to `j` after entering the if condition.***
