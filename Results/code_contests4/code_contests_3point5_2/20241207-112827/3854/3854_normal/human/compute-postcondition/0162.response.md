Postcondition: ***`k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `d` is not 0, then `nn[d]` is not 0, `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `d` is 0, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. In the case where `nn[d] == 0`, all variables keep their previous values except `nn[d]` which is assigned the value of `j`.***
