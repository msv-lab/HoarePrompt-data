According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to n. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `k + 1`, which means `k + 1` should be within the range of 1 to n for the loop to execute. So `k` needs to be adjusted such that `k + 1` is within the range of 1 to n. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value within the range, so `j` should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`k` is adjusted such that `k + 1` is within the range of 1 to n, `j` is incremented to the next value within the range for the loop to execute one more time**
