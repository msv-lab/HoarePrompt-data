According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `core[j]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `d` is assigned a value from `ins[j][i]`, `d` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]` is updated accordingly.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater or equal to 1, `j` is 2, updated values based on the loop body conditions mentioned above.**
