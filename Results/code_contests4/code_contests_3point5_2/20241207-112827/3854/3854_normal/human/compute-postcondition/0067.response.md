According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 1, all elements in `nn` are adjusted, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[n][i+1]`, `core[n]` is assigned the value of `i + 2` for the loop to execute one more time, `nn[j]` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`k` is greater than 1, all elements in `nn` are adjusted, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[n][i+1]`, `core[n]` is assigned the value of `i + 2` for the loop to execute one more time, `nn[j]` is 0**
