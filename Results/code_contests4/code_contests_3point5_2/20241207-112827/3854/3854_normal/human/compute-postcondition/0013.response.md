According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `ins`, `cell`, `nn`, and `core` do not directly impact the loop execution. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`k` is greater than 0**
