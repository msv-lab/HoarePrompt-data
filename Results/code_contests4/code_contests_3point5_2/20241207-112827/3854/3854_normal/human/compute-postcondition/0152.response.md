Postcondition: ***`k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `nn[d]` is not 0, then `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.***
