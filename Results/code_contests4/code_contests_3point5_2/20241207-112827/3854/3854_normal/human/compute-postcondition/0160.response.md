Output State: **`k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `cell[d]` is True, if `d` is not 0 then `nn[d]` is not 0, `core[j]` and `core[nn[d]]` are both assigned the value of `i + 1`, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `nn[d]` is updated to the value of `j`.**
