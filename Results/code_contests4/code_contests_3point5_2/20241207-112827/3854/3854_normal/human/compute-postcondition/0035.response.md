Postcondition: ***k is greater than 0, all elements in nn are 0, n is greater than 1, j is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, core[j] is equal to i + 1 if nn[d] != 0 and core[j] is equal to 0 if nn[d] == 0, d is assigned the value of ins[j][i], d is not equal to 0, the cell[d] condition is true if nn[d] != 0 and false if nn[d] == 0, nn[d] is assigned the value of j if nn[d] != 0 and nn[d] equals j if nn[d] == 0.***
