Based on the code provided, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `core[j]` is updated based on the next iteration, `d` is updated based on the next iteration, `ins[j][i]` is updated based on the next iteration, `cell[d]` is updated based on the next iteration, `nn[d]` is updated based on the next iteration**
