According to the code, the loop can execute for the next iteration if `j` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` should remain the same.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `nn[j]` is assigned the value 0 for the loop to execute another time**
