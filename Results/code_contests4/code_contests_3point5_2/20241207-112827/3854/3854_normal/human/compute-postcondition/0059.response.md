Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted accordingly, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][i]`, `core[3]` is assigned the value of `i + 1, d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][i]`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `cell[d]` is True, `core[j]` is assigned the value of `core[nn[d]]` which is equal to `i + 1`, and `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
