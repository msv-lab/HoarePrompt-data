Example Answer:
`nn[j]` is assigned the value 0. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the value of `j+1` may or may not be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is greater than 0, value of `nn[j]` is 0, `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, value of `nn[j]` is 0, `j` is increased by 1**
