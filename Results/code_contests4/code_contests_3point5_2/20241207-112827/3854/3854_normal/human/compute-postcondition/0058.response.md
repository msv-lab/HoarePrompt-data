Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `nn` elements are adjusted accordingly, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][i]`, `core[3]` is assigned the value of `i + 1, d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][i]`. If `nn[d]` is 0, then `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`.***
