Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted based on the conditions, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `nn[d]` equals 0, the program makes adjustments to `nn` based on the conditions specified.***
