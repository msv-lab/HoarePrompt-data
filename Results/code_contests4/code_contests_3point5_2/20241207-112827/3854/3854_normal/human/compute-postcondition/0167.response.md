Output State: **`k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are either 0 or assigned based on the conditions within the loop, `n` is equal to the total number of iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n`, `d` is assigned values based on `ins[j][i]` in each iteration. The values of `core[j]`, `cell[d]`, and the assignments of `core[j]`, `core[nn[d]]`, and `nn[d]` are based on the conditions within the loop for each iteration.**
