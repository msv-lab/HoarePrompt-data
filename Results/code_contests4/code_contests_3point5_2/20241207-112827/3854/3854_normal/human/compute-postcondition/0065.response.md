According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times. Before the loop starts, the loop will execute one more time, so the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`k` is greater than 1, all elements in `nn` are adjusted, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[n][i+1]`, `core[n]` is assigned the value of `i + 2` for the loop to execute one more time**.
