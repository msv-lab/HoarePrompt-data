According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again `j` should still be less than or equal to `k`.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should still be less than or equal to `k`**
