Example Answer:
`nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, where `d` is the value of `ins[j][i]`. The previous values of the variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`**
