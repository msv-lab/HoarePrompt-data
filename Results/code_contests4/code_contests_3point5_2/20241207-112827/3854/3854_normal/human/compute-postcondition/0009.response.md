According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be updated to 1, and the values in the 2nd row of `ins` need to be assigned based on user input.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100; `ins` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x m with values taken from user input; `cell` is a list of `False` values with a length ranging from 2 to 101; `nn` is a list of `0` values with a length ranging from 1 to 101; `core` is a list of 0 values with a length of (n + 1); for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1 with the updated values assigned to the 2nd row of `ins**
