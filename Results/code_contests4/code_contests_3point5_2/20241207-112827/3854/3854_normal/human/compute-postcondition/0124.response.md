According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `k`. If `n` is at least 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1.
State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
