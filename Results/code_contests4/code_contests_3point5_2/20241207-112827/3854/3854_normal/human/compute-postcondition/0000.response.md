Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100**
