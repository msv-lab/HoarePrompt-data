Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `core[j]` is 0 and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `core[j]` is set to `i + 1`. If `core[j]` is 0 and `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `core[j]` remains 0. In both cases, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. The condition `cell[d]` is true if `nn[d]` is not equal to 0 and false if `nn[d]` is equal to 0. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `nn[d]` is set to `j`. If `nn[d]` is equal to 0, then `nn[d]` remains 0.***
