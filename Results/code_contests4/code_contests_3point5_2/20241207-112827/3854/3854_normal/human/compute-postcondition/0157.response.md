Output State: **`k` is greater or equal to 1, all `nn[j]` values are 0 for j ranging from 1 to k, `n` is greater or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`, `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, `core[nn[d]]` is not affected. If `d` is not 0, then `nn[d]` is not 0, `cell[d]` is True, and `nn[d]`, `core[j]`, and `core[nn[d]]` are updated according to the conditions. If `d` is 0, `nn[d]` is assigned the value of `j`, and `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.**
