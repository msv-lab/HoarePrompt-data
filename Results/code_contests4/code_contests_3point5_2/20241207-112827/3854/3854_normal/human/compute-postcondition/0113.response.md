Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `k`, `j + 1`, `core[j + 1]`, `d = ins[j + 1][i]`, `ins[j + 1][i]`, and `nn[d]` are appropriately updated based on the conditions of the program. If `core[j]` is equal to 0, then for the loop to execute again, the conditions based on `core[j]`, `d`, `cell[d]`, and `nn[d]` must be reevaluated. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, `core[j]`, `core[nn[d]]` are both equal to `i + 1`, `cell[d]` is True, `j + 1`, `d = ins[j + 1][i]`, `ins[j + 1][i]`, and `nn[d]` are appropriately updated based on the conditions of the program, `nn[d]` is assigned the value `j`. If `d` is not equal to 0 and `nn[d]` is equal to 0, the program will follow the specified updates and conditions.***
