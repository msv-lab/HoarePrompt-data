Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted based on the conditions in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute the final time, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[n][i]`, `core[n]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Depending on the conditions met during the iterations, `nn`, `cell`, and `core` are updated accordingly.**
