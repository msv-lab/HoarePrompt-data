Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, and `d` is assigned the value of `ins[j][i]`. If `nn[d]` is not equal to 0, then `k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted accordingly, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[2][k]`, cell at index `d` is set to `True`, `core[j]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and `core[nn[d]]` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `nn[d]` equals 0, the program makes adjustments to `nn` based on the conditions specified.***
