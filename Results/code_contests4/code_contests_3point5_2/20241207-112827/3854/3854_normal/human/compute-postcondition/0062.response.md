Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, all elements in `nn` are adjusted accordingly, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][i]`, `core[3]` is assigned the value of `i + 1, d` is assigned the value of `ins[3][i]`. If `core[j]` is 0 and `d` is not equal to 0, additional operations are performed on `nn`, `cell`, `core`, and `j` based on the conditions mentioned. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.***
