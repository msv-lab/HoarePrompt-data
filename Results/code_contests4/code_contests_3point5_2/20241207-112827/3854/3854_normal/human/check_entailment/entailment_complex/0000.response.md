Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the number of cores, cycles, and cache memory. It then processes the instructions for each core within the specified number of cycles. The program correctly simulates the processor based on the given instructions, handling cases where multiple cores try to write to the same memory cell and ensuring that cores are locked accordingly.

The program updates the state of each core and memory cell according to the rules described in the problem description. It correctly identifies when a core should be locked due to conflicts with other cores writing to the same cell. The final output of the program is the cycle number at which each core will become locked, if applicable.

Overall, the program functions as intended and follows the problem description accurately.
