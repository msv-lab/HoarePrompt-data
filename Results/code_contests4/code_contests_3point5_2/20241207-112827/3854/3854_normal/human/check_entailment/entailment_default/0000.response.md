Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It initializes the necessary lists to keep track of instructions, memory cells, and cores.
- The code processes the input data through nested loops to update core values based on the given instructions.
- Finally, it prints the core values which indicate the cycle during which each core will become locked.
- The code seems to adhere to the problem description and handles the scenario of cores trying to write to the same memory cell, leading to a deadlock situation.
