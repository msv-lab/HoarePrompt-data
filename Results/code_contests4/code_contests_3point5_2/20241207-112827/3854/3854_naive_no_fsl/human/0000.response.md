Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly simulates the behavior of the multi-core processor as described in the problem statement. It handles the cases where multiple cores try to write to the same memory cell, resulting in a deadlock situation. The program correctly identifies the cycle when a core will be locked and prints the output accordingly. The implementation follows the logic provided in the problem description and there are no apparent issues or edge cases where the program might fail to produce the correct output.
