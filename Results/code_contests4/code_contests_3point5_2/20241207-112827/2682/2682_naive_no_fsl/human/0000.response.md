Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input data for each student, calculates their BMI using the provided formula, and outputs the student ID numbers of those with a BMI of 25 or higher. The program correctly uses the condition `if 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) ** 2` to determine if a student is suspected of being obese. The program handles the case where the number of students does not exceed 50 as stated in the problem description. Additionally, the program outputs the student ID numbers in the order in which they were entered. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
