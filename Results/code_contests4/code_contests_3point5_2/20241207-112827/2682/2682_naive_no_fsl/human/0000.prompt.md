You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Obesity is cited as the cause of many adult diseases. In the past, with a few exceptions, it was unrelated to high school students. However, it is no longer unrealistic to suffer from lack of exercise due to excessive studying for entrance exams, or to become bulimia nervosa due to stress. It may be a problem that high school students should be fully interested in.

So you decided to work as an assistant to a teacher in the health room to create a program to find students suspected of being obese from student data.

The method is to calculate a numerical value called BMI (Body Mass Index). BMI is given by the following formula.

<image>


BMI = 22 is standard, and above 25 is suspected of being obese.

Create a program that calculates BMI from each student's weight and height information and outputs the student ID numbers of 25 or more students.



input

The input is given in the following format:


s1, w1, h1
s2, w2, h2
...
...


si (1 ≤ si ≤ 2,000), wi (1 ≤ wi ≤ 200), hi (1.0 ≤ hi ≤ 2.0) are the student ID numbers (integers), weight (real numbers), and height (real numbers) of the i-th student, respectively. Represents.

The number of students does not exceed 50.

output

The student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher are output on one line in the order in which they were entered.

Example

Input

1001,50.0,1.60
1002,60.0,1.70
1003,70.0,1.80
1004,80.0,1.70
1005,90.0,1.60


Output

1004
1005
Program:
```
for line in stdin:
    (number, weight, height) = line.split(',')
    if 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) ** 2:
        print(number)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
