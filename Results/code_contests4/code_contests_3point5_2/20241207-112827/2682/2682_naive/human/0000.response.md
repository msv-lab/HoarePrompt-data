Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program reads input from stdin line by line, splits the line into student ID, weight, and height, calculates the BMI using the provided formula, and outputs the student ID if the BMI is 25 or higher. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles each student's data independently. It calculates the BMI correctly and compares it to the threshold of 25 to identify students suspected of being obese. The program iterates through all the students' data and outputs the student IDs of those with BMI 25 or higher. Since the program addresses the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
