Correctness: **True**

The program reads each line of input, extracts the student ID, weight, and height from the line, calculates the BMI using the provided formula, and prints the student ID if the BMI is 25 or higher. This aligns with the problem description which asks for the student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher to be output in the order they were entered. The program correctly identifies students suspected of being obese based on their BMI values.
