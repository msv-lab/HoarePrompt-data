Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input data of students in the format "si, wi, hi", calculates the BMI for each student using the formula provided in the problem description, and then prints the student ID numbers of students with a BMI of 25 or higher.

The program iterates over each line of input data, extracts the student ID, weight, and height, calculates the BMI by dividing weight by height squared, and then checks if the BMI is greater than or equal to 25. If the condition is met, it prints the student ID number.

Since the program follows the specified logic and correctly identifies students suspected of being obese based on their BMI, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
