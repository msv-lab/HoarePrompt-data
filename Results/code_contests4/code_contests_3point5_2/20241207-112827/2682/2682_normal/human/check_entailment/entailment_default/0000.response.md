Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. It reads the input data of each student in the format "si, wi, hi", calculates the BMI using the given formula, and checks if the BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0. If the condition is met, it prints the student's ID number. The code handles the data for each student as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code and confirm that it correctly identifies students with a BMI of 25 or higher. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned where the code fails to meet the requirements.
