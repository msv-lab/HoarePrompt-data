Functionality: **The function `func()` processes the data of students provided in the format "si, wi, hi", where si is the student ID number, wi is the weight of the student, and hi is the height of the student. It reads the input data from standard input and checks if the weight to height ratio of each student is greater than or equal to 25.0. If this condition is met, it prints the student's ID number. The function does not accept any parameters and handles the data for each student according to specified constraints.**
