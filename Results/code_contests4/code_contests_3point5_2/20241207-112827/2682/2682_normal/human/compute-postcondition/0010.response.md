Example Answer:
`number`, `weight`, and `height` are assigned values from the `line` after splitting it by ','. The condition 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) is still True, so the output state is: `number`, `weight`, `height` are assigned values from the last `line`, 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) is still True.
Output State: **`number`, `weight`, `height` are assigned values from the last `line`, 25.0 <= float(weight) / float(height) is still True**
