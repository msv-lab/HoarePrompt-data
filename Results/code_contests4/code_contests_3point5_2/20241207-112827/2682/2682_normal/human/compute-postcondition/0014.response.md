The function `func()` does not accept any parameters. It is responsible for processing data of students in the format "si, wi, hi" where si is the student ID number, wi is the weight of the student, and hi is the height of the student. The constraints for the parameters are given as: 1 ≤ si ≤ 2,000 for student ID, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 200 for student weight, and 1.0 ≤ hi ≤ 2.0 for student height. The function will handle data for each student based on the given constraints.
