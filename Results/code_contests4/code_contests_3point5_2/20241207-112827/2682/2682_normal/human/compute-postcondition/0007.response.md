Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `number`. The value of `number` is assigned from `line` after splitting with ','. Since the initial state provides no information about the value of `line`, we cannot determine the exact value of `number`. Therefore, the Output State is: `number`, `weight`, `height` are assigned values from `line` after splitting with ','
Output State: **`number`, `weight`, `height` are assigned values from `line` after splitting with ','**
