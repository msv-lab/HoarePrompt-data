Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum amount of discrete jumps required to reach the last skyscraper. It considers all possible cases where a jump can be made based on the given conditions and keeps track of the minimum jumps required. The logic seems to cover all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description. Additionally, the program includes input handling and necessary libraries for execution. Although the code is a bit complex due to additional functionality for input/output and debugging, the core logic for calculating the minimum jumps appears to be correct.
