Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimal amount of discrete jumps required for Vasya to reach the last skyscraper. The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum jumps required at each skyscraper. It considers the conditions for a jump to be discrete and updates the minimum jumps accordingly.

The program iterates through the heights of the skyscrapers, maintains two stacks for the maximum and minimum heights encountered so far, and updates the jumps based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description. Finally, it prints the minimum jumps required to reach the last skyscraper.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the program covers all the potential cases and correctly calculates the minimal amount of discrete jumps. Hence, the correctness of the program is True.
