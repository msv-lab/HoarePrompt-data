Example Answer:
`dp[i]` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `dp[maxidx[-1]] + 1`. The specific values of `dp[i]` and `dp[maxidx[-1]]` are not provided, so the output state is: 'maxstack' is empty. If 'minidx' evaluates to true, then 'maxstack' will have a specific value. Otherwise, 'maxstack' remains empty. When (maxidx) is true, 'maxstack' will have a specific value based on the condition of (maxidx).
Output State: **'maxstack' is empty. If 'minidx' evaluates to true, then 'maxstack' will have a specific value. Otherwise, 'maxstack' remains empty. When (maxidx) is true, 'maxstack' will have a specific value based on the condition of (maxidx)**
