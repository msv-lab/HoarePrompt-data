Example Answer:
The last element of `maxstack` is removed by using `maxidx.pop()`. After the removal, the last element of `maxstack` will be different and will satisfy the condition that it is less than x. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 'maxstack' should be adjusted such that its last element is less than x.
Output State: **'maxstack' should be adjusted such that its last element is less than x**
