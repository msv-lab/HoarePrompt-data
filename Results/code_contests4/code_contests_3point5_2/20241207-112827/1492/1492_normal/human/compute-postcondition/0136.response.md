Example Answer:
The `debug_print(dp)` statement simply prints the contents of the variable `dp`. The variable `dp` was updated with 'n' elements containing the minimum steps to reach each element before this statement was executed. Therefore, there is no change in the values of other variables. 
Output State: **At the end of the loop, 'n' is an input integer within the specified range, 'first' is assigned the first element of the list 'ar', 'dp' is updated with 'n' elements containing the minimum steps to reach each element, 'maxstack' and 'maxidx' are empty, 'minstack' contains the minimum element of 'ar', 'minidx' contains the index of the minimum element, 'ar' is a list with at least 1 element**
