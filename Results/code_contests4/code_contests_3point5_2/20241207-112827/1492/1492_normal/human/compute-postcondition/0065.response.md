According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition that `maxstack` is not empty and the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`. Right before the loop, `maxstack` contains the value of `first` or is empty, so for the loop to execute the first time, `maxstack` must contain the value of `first`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **'n' is an input integer within the specified range, 'first' is assigned the first element of the list 'ar', 'dp' is updated with 'n' elements, 'maxstack' contains the value of 'first', 'maxidx' contains 0 or is empty, 'minstack' contains the minimum element of 'ar' and 'x' as its last element, 'minidx' is empty, 'ar' is a list with at least 1 element, 'i' is equal to 1, 'dp' at index 'i' is updated, 'maxidx' has 'i' appended to its elements, 'minstack' is empty, 'minidx' is empty**
