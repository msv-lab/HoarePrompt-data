Postcondition: ***'maxstack' is initially empty. If 'minidx' evaluates to true and 'minstack[-1]' is equal to 'x', then 'maxstack' will remain empty. Otherwise, 'maxstack' will still be empty. Additionally, if 'maxstack' is not empty and the last element of 'maxstack' is equal to 'x', then 'maxstack' will remain unchanged, otherwise 'maxstack' will still be empty.***
