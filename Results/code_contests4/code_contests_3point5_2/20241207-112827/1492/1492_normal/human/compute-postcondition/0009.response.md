Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the specified range, `first` is assigned the first element of the list `ar`, list `dp` is initialized with `n` elements all set to 0, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `maxidx` is a list containing 0, `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `minidx` is a list containing the value 0, for the loop to execute the first time `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, after the last iteration `n`, `first`, `dp`, `maxstack`, `maxidx`, `minstack`, and `minidx` have been modified. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0.***
