Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the specified range, `first` is assigned the first element of the list `ar`, list `dp` is initialized with `n` elements all set to 0, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first` or empty if `x` is less than or equal to the first element of `ar`, `maxidx` is a list containing 0 or empty based on the values in `maxstack`, `minstack` is a list containing the minimum element of `ar`, `minidx` is a list containing the index of the minimum element in `ar`, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to 0, `dp` at index `i` is updated to be the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`. If `minidx` is true, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the minimum of the current `dp[i]` and `dp[minidx[-1]] + 1`.***
