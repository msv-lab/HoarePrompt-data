Example Answer:
The `pop()` function removes and returns the last element from the `minidx` list. Since the initial state mentions that `maxstack` remains empty, the removal of an element from `minidx` does not affect `maxstack`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxstack` remains empty.
Output State: **`maxstack` remains empty**
