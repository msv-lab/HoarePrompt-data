According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `maxstack` and `x`. If the last element of `maxstack` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxstack` has the last element removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than the new last element of `maxstack`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer within the specified range, `first` is assigned the first element of the list `ar`, list `dp` is initialized with `n` elements all set to 0, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first` with the last element removed, `maxidx` is a list containing 0, `minstack` is a list containing the minimum element of `ar`, `minidx` is a list containing the index of the minimum element in `ar`, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to 0, `dp` at index `i` is updated to be the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `x` must be greater than the first element of `ar`, `maxstack` has the last element removed, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than the last element of `maxstack`, `maxidx` has the last element removed**
