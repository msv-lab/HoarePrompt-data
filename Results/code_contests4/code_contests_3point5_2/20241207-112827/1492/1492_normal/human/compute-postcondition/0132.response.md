Example Answer:
'minidx' is appended with the value of 'i'. The state of 'maxstack' is determined by the initial conditions provided. If 'minidx' evaluates to true and 'minstack[-1]' is equal to 'x', 'maxstack' will remain empty. Otherwise, 'maxstack' will still be empty after the if statement executes. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'maxstack' is initially empty and 'minidx' evaluates to true and 'minstack[-1]' is equal to 'x', then 'maxstack' will remain empty. Otherwise, 'maxstack' will still be empty after the if statement executes. 'minstack' will have 'x' appended to it.
Output State: **If 'maxstack' is initially empty and 'minidx' evaluates to true and 'minstack[-1]' is equal to 'x', then 'maxstack' will remain empty. Otherwise, 'maxstack' will still be empty after the if statement executes. 'minstack' will have 'x' appended to it.**
