Example Answer:
A list `dp` is initialized with `n` number of elements all set to 0. The value of `n` is an input integer within the specified range. The variable `first` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the specified range; `first` is assigned the first element of the list `ar`; list `dp` is initialized with `n` elements all set to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the specified range; `first` is assigned the first element of the list `ar`; list `dp` is initialized with `n` elements all set to 0**
