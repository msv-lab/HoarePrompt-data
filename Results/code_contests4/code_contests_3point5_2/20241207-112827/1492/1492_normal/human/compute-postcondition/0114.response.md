Example Answer:
The last element of `maxstack` is removed by using the `pop()` function. If the last element of `maxstack` was less than `x`, then the new state of `maxstack` will have one less element. However, if the last element of `maxstack` was not less than `x`, then `maxstack` remains the same. 
Output State: **'maxstack' should be adjusted such that its last element is less than x**
