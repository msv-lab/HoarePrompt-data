According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minstack`. If `minstack` is not empty and the last element of `minstack` is greater than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minstack` has removed the last element, so for the loop to execute one more time, `minstack` needs to have at least one more element after the removal. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer within the specified range, `first` is assigned the first element of the list `ar`, list `dp` is initialized with `n` elements all set to 0, `maxstack` is a list containing the value of `first`, `maxidx` is a list containing 0, `minstack` is a list containing the value of `first` with at least one more element, `minidx` is a list containing the value 0, `ar` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is equal to 0, `dp` at index `i` is updated to be the value of `dp[i - 1] + 1, for the loop to execute again `minstack` needs to have at least one more element after the removal**
