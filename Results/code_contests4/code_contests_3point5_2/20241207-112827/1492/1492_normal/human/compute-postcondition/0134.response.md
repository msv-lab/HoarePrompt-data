Example Answer:
'maxidx' is appended with the value 'i'. The previous state of 'maxidx' is unknown, so after execution, 'maxidx' will contain the value 'i'. The states of 'maxstack' and 'minstack' are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 'maxstack' contains 'x', 'minstack' contains 'x', 'maxidx' contains 'i'.
Output State: **'maxstack' contains 'x', 'minstack' contains 'x', 'maxidx' contains 'i'**
