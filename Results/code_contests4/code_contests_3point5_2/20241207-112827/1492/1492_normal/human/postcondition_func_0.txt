The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then calls another function `func_2` to get a list `ar`. It iterates through the list `ar` and calculates the minimum steps needed to reach each element while maintaining two stacks (`maxstack` and `minstack`) to keep track of maximum and minimum elements. The function aims to output the maximum possible height of a staircase that can be built using the given parameters `n` and `h_i`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 3*10^5, and `h_i` are integers between 1 and 10^9.
