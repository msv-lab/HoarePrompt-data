Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly follows the problem description by calculating the minimal amount of discrete jumps required to reach the last skyscraper.
2. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` all contribute to the main functionality of the program as described in the annotations.
3. The program handles the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as the range of inputs for `n` and `h_i`.
4. The annotations complement the code by explaining the purpose and functionality of each function, aiding in the understanding of the overall program.
