Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimal number of discrete jumps needed to reach the last skyscraper based on the given heights of the skyscrapers. The program uses dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum steps required to reach each skyscraper while considering the conditions for a jump to be discrete. The logic for updating the steps and maintaining the minstack and maxstack is correctly implemented in the program. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
