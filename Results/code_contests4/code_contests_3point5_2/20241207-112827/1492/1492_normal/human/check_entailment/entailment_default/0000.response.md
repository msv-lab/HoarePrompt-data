Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement to calculate the minimal amount of discrete jumps required to reach the last skyscraper.
2. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` work together to read input, process the heights of the skyscrapers, and calculate the minimal jumps needed.
3. The code handles various scenarios such as when the heights of the skyscrapers are increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating.
4. The output hints provided also align with the code's functionality, reinforcing the correctness of the program.
