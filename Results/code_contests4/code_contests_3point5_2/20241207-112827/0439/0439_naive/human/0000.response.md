Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of north magnets required to satisfy all the conditions mentioned in the problem description. It checks for the possibility of placing magnets in such a way that all the conditions are met and returns the minimum number of north magnets required. The program also handles edge cases such as when the grid contains only white cells or when there are no north magnets required. The implementation of the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and helper functions like `get_adj` and `dfs` are in line with the problem requirements. Overall, the program seems to correctly solve the given problem.
