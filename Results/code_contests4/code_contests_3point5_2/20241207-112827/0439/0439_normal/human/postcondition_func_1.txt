The function `get_adj` accepts two integer parameters `i` and `j`. It generates a list `adj` containing tuples representing adjacent positions, then filters those tuples based on certain conditions involving the dimensions `n` and `m` and the content of the `grid`. The function finally returns a list `res` containing the tuples that meet the specified conditions.
