Example Answer:
The `pop` method removes the key 'end' from the dictionary `kwargs` and writes its corresponding value to the file. Since the value of 'end' is '\n', a new line character will be written to the file. The value of `at_start` is not affected, `n` and `m` remain positive integers, and the loop execution condition remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `at_start` is False, and a new line character is written to the file.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `at_start` is False, and a new line character is written to the file**
