Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are input integers, `grid` is a list of `n` input strings, `grid` is not equal to ['.' * m for _ in range(n)], `func_3(-1)` is called if conditions are met, `grit` is the transpose of `grid`, `grit` is not empty, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`, `start` is not equal to -1, there are no '.' between indexes `start` and `stop` in the string `row`. For the loop to execute again, at least one row in `grit` must meet the specified conditions, and `start` and `stop` are updated based on the indexes of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`.***
