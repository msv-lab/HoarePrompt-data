Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `n` and `m` are integers, `grid` is a list of `n` strings, `grid` is not equal to `['.' * m for _ in range(n)]`, `func_3(-1)` is called if conditions are met, `grit` is the transpose of `grid` which is not empty, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`, `start` is not -1, and there are no '.' between indexes `start` and `stop` in the string `row`. The loop will continue until all rows in `grit` meet the specified conditions, and `start` and `stop` are updated based on the indexes of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`.**
