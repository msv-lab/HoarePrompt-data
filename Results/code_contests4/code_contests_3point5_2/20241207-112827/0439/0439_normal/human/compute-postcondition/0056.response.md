Postcondition: ***`si` and `sj` are updated to the coordinates of the last element in the stack. If `visited[si][sj]` is True, the last element is popped, `si` and `sj` are updated to the coordinates of the new last element, `visited[si][sj]` is set accordingly, and `component` remains 1. If `visited[si][sj]` is False, `si` and `sj` are updated to the coordinates of the last element in the stack, `visited[si][sj]` is True, `component` is 1, and the loop continues to append coordinates `(ai, aj)` to the stack as long as `visited[ai][aj]` is False.***
