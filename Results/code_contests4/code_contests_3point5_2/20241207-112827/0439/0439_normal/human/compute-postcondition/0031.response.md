Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `grid` is a list of `n` input strings, `grid` is not equal to ['.' * m for _ in range(n)], `func_3(-1)` is called if conditions are met, `grit` is the transpose of `grid`, `grit` is not empty, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`, `start` is not equal to -1 and there are no '.' between indexes `start` and `stop` in the string `row`, for the loop to execute again there must be at least one row in `grit` that meets the specified conditions, `start` and `stop` are updated based on the indexes of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`.**
