According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of the `get_adj(si, sj)` function. If the function returns a non-empty list of adjacent coordinates, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `si` and `sj` being updated to the coordinates of the last element in the stack and `visited[si][sj]` being set to True ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.
State: **`si` and `sj` are updated to the coordinates of the last element in the stack, `visited[si][sj]` is True, `component` is 1**
