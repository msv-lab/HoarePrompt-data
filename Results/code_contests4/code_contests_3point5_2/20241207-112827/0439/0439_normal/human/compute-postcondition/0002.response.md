According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The input grid, `n`, and `m` being positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000 do not directly affect the loop execution. Since `at_start` is True, it implies that the loop is starting for the first time. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `args` list must have at least 1 element, and `x` will be the first element in the list.
State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list**
