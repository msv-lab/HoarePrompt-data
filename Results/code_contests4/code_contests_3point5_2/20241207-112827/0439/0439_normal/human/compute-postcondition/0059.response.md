The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `i` and `j`, which are positive integers representing the coordinates of a cell in a grid. The input grid is a valid grid of size n x m consisting of characters "#" and "." only, where n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000. The function returns the value of the variable `component`, which is currently set to 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function dfs is to accept two positive integer parameters representing cell coordinates in a grid and return the value of the variable `component`.
