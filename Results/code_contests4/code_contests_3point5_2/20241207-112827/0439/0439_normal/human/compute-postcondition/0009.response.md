Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the file. The values of `n`, `m`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list**
