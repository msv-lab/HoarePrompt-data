Example Answer: 
The `write()` method of the file object writes the separator `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact output. However, it is known that the value of `x` is written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list and the value of `x` is written to the file.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list and the value of `x` is written to the file**
