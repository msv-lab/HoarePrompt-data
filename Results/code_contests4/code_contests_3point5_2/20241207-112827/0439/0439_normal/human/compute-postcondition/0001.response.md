Example Answer:
`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The input grid contains only "#" and "." characters; `at_start` is True.
Output State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The input grid contains only "#" and "." characters; `at_start` is True**
