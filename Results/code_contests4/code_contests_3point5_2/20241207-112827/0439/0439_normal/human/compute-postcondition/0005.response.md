Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. `at_start` is True. For the loop to execute the first time, `args` is a list with at least 1 element and `x` is the first element in the list. The program remains in the same state after the execution of the if else block.***
