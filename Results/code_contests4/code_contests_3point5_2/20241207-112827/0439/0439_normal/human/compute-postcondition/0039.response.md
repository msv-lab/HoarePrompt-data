Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers, `grid` is a list of `n` strings that is not equal to `['.' * m for _ in range(n)]`, `grit` is the transpose of `grid` which is not empty, `start` and `stop` are assigned the index of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`, `start` is not -1 and there are no '.' between indexes `start` and `stop` in the string `row`. At least one row in `grit` meets the specified conditions and `start` and `stop` are updated based on the indexes of the first and last occurrence of '#' in the string `row`.***
