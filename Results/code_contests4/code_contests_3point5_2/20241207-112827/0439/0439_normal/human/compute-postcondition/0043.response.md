Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input integers `n` and `m`, constructs a grid of strings based on the input, and performs checks on the grid rows. If any row contains invalid characters or missing '#' symbols, it calls `func_3(-1)`. The function then transposes the grid and repeats the row checks. Finally, it calls `func_3(func_1(n, m, grid))` with the result of conditions being met for the initial state. The functionality may vary based on the actual behavior of `func_1`, `func_3`, and the correctness of the grid checks, which are not explicitly described in the annotations.**
