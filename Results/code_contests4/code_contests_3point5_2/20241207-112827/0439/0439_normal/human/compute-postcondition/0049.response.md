According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `get_adj` function and the `visited` array. If there are adjacent coordinates that have not been visited, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `si` and `sj` are updated to the coordinates of the last element in the stack, `visited[si][sj]` is True, `component` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be adjacent coordinates that have not been visited. So, the next coordinates `(ai, aj)` that are appended to the stack should have `visited[ai][aj]` as False.
State: **`si` and `sj` are updated to the coordinates of the last element in the stack, `visited[si][sj]` is True, `component` is 1. If `visited[ai][aj]` is False, then the coordinates `(ai, aj)` are appended to the stack for the loop to execute one more time**
