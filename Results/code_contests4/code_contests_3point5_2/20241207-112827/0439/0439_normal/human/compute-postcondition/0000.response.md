Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the values ' ' (space) and sys.stdout to the variables sep and file respectively, using kwargs.pop(). The variables n and m are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The input grid contains only "#" and "." characters.
Output State: **n and m remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The input grid contains only "#" and "." characters.**
