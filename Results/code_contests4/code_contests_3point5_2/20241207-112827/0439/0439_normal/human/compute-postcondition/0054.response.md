Postcondition: ***`si`, `sj` are updated to the coordinates of the last element in the stack, `visited[si][sj]` is True, `component` is 1. If `visited[ai][aj]` is False, then the coordinates `(ai, aj)` are appended to the stack for the loop to execute another time and the coordinates `(ai, aj)` are appended to the stack.***
