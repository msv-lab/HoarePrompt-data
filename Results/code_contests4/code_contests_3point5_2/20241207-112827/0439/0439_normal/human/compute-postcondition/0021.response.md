Example Answer:
The `flush()` method is called on the file object. This method flushes the internal buffer, meaning any unwritten data is written to the file. The `at_start` variable is not affected by this operation. The new line character remains written to the file. If the keyword argument 'flush' existed in kwargs, it would have been popped. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `at_start` is False, a new line character is written to the file, and the keyword argument 'flush' is popped from kwargs.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, `at_start` is False, a new line character is written to the file, and the keyword argument 'flush' is popped from kwargs**
