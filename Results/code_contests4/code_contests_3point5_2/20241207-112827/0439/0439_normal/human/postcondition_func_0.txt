The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `grid`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the grid, while `grid` is a 2D list of characters with "#" for black cells and "." for white cells. The function iterates through the grid, incrementing a count based on the result of the `dfs` function for valid black cell pairs. Finally, it returns the total count of these components. However, the code does not include the implementation of the `dfs` function, and its behavior is not defined in the provided context.
