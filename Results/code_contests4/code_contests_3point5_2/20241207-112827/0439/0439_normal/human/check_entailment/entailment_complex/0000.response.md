Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python code and the annotations, it can be observed that the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations provided. The functions in the code handle the grid coloring, placement of magnets, and checking for valid configurations according to the problem requirements. The functions correctly iterate through the grid, identify components, determine adjacency, and handle the placement of magnets based on the given conditions. The main function `func_2` reads the input grid, performs necessary checks, transposes the grid, and computes the minimum number of north magnets required using the `func_1` function.

Overall, the code appears to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and works as expected based on the given requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the code is evaluated as **True**.
