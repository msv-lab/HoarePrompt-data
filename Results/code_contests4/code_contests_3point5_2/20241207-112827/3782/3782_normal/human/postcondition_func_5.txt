The function `func_6` accepts three parameters `n`, `k`, and `fac`. `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, and `fac` is a list of integers with absolute values less than or equal to 10^9. The function returns 0 if k is greater than n. Otherwise, it computes and returns the result of func_3(fac[n]) and func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])) based on the given constraints.
