You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For a finite set of integers X, let f(X)=\max X - \min X.

Given are N integers A_1,...,A_N.

We will choose K of them and let S be the set of the integers chosen. If we distinguish elements with different indices even when their values are the same, there are {}_N C_K ways to make this choice. Find the sum of f(S) over all those ways.

Since the answer can be enormous, print it \bmod (10^9+7).

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq N
* |A_i| \leq 10^9

Input

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`c` is the sum of `a + b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, the program retains the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `c` remains the sum of `a + b`.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of 'a' and 'b', which is stored in 'c'. If 'c' is greater than or equal to 'mod', the initial values of 'a' and 'b' are retained.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns the result. If the sum is greater than or equal to a specified value `mod`, the initial values of `a` and `b` are retained. The function does not handle the case when `mod` is not defined or when `mod` is not an integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_2(a, b):
    return (a - b) % mod
    #The program returns the result of subtracting 'b' from 'a', then taking the modulus 'mod' of the result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the result of subtracting `b` from `a`, then takes the modulus of the result with respect to an undefined variable `mod`. The function returns this calculated value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(a, b):
    return a * b % mod
    #The program returns the result of multiplying variable 'a' by variable 'b' and then taking the modulus of the result by variable 'mod'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two variables a and b, multiplies them, and returns the result after taking the modulus by the variable mod. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities based on the provided code.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_4(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *All variables in the precondition remain unchanged. `b` is not equal to 0
    if (b % 2 == 1) :
        return func_3(a, func_4(a, b - 1))
        #The program returns the result of calling function `func_3` with arguments `a` and the result of calling function `func_4` with arguments `a` and `b-1`
    else :
        temp = func_4(a, b / 2)
        return temp * temp
        #The program returns the result of squaring the value of `temp` which is the result of `func_4(a, b / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It evaluates different cases based on the value of `b`: 
- Case 1: If `b` is 0, the function returns 1.
- Case 2: If `b` is odd, it recursively calls `func_3` with arguments `a` and the result of `func_4(a, b-1)`.
- Case 3: If `b` is even, it recursively calculates `temp` as `func_4(a, b / 2)` and returns the square of `temp`.
The function operates through these cases based on the value of `b` to determine the return value.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers where 1 <= i <= N and |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_5(a):
    return func_4(a, mod - 2)
    #The program returns the result of func_4(a, mod - 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `a` and returns the result of calling another function `func_4` with parameters `a` and `mod - 2`. The actual constraints regarding the values of `a`, `mod`, and the behavior of `func_4` are not explicitly mentioned in the annotations. The function should be updated to provide more clarity on the constraints and behavior of `func_4`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers with absolute values less than or equal to 10^9.**
def func_6(n, k, fac):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers with absolute values less than or equal to 10^9. K is less than or equal to n
    return func_3(fac[n], func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])))
    #The program returns the result of func_3(fac[n]) where n is a positive integer and the result of func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])) where k is a positive integer less than or equal to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts three parameters `n`, `k`, and `fac`. `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, and `fac` is a list of integers with absolute values less than or equal to 10^9. The function returns 0 if k is greater than n. Otherwise, it computes and returns the result of func_3(fac[n]) and func_5(func_3(fac[n - k], fac[k])) based on the given constraints.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are positive integers such that 1 <= K <= N. A_i are integers such that |A_i| <= 10^9.**
def func_7():
    n, k = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    a = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    fac = [0] * (n + 5)
    fac[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 5):
        fac[i] = func_3(fac[i - 1], i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n, list `a` is created from the input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        diff = func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])
        
        ways = func_6(n, k, fac)
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))
        
        ways = func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac))
        
        ans = func_1(ans, func_3(diff, ways))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= k <= n, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, where `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i], a[i - 1]) for the last iteration, and `ways` is updated by calling `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)) for the last iteration
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads input values `N`, `K`, and a list of integers `A_i`. It calculates various values using helper functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_6`, and updates the variable `ans` in each iteration of the loop. The function then prints the final value of `ans`. However, the annotations suggest that the function deals with specific constraints and operations that are not explicitly present in the code, so the actual functionality might differ from what is described in the comments. Additionally, the function does not have any return value specified.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
