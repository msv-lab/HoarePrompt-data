Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program does not handle the case when the sum of elements `c` in `func_1` is equal to `mod`. The annotation mentions that if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, the initial values of `a` and `b` are retained, which is not in line with the actual code logic.
2. The annotations mention specific constraints and operations that are not explicitly present in the code, leading to potential discrepancies in functionality.
3. The code does not fully adhere to the problem description in terms of handling all potential cases, such as edge cases where the input values are at their constraints limits.
