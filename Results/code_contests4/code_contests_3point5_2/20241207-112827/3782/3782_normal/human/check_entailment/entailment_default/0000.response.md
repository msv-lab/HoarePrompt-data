Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in function number 6 (`func_6`). The function is supposed to compute the sum of `f(S)` over all possible ways of choosing `K` elements from the given list and finding the maximum difference between the chosen elements. However, the function only computes and returns a single value based on the provided constraints, which does not cover all possible combinations of choosing `K` elements. The function should iterate over all possible combinations of selecting `K` elements and calculate the sum of `f(S)` for each combination.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
