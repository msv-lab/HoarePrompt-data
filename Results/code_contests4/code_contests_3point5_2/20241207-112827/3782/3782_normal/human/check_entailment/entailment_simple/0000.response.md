Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K integers from the given N integers A_1,...,A_N, where f(S) is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum element in the set S. The program uses various helper functions to calculate the combinations, factorials, and the final answer modulo (10^9+7) as required by the problem description. 

The program ensures correctness by correctly calculating the necessary values and updating the answer accordingly in each iteration of the loop, taking into account the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. The final answer is printed after all iterations, ensuring that the correct result is produced for the given input. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible cases within the given constraints.
