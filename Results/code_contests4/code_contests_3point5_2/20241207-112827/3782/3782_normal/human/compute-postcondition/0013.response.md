According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2 because the range starts from 0 to n-1. So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, since `a` is sorted from the input values, it needs to be clarified that `a` is sorted. Also, since `fac[0]` is 1 and `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, it needs to be ensured that these conditions are met. Finally, `ans` is 0 initially, so it needs to be included in the state.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is 0**
