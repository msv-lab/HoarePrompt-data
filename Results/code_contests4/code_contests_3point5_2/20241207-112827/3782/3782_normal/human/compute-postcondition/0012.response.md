Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. Since no calculations are performed and no variables are affected, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n, `a` is sorted from the input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is 0**
