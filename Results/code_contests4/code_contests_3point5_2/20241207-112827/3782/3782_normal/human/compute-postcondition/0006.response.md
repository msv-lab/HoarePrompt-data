According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `k` must be between 1 and `n`, list `a` must be created from the input values, `fac[0]` must be 1, and `fac[i]` must be assigned the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` for the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, 1 <= `k` <= `n`, list `a` is created from input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute, `fac[1]` is assigned the result of `func_3(fac[0], 1)`**
