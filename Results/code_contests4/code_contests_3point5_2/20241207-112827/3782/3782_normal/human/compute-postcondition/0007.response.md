Example Answer:
`fac[i]` is assigned the result of calling `func_3` with arguments `fac[i - 1]` and `i`. Since `i` is initially 2, `fac[1]` is used as an argument, which was previously assigned the result of `func_3(fac[0], 1)`. The value of `fac[0]` is 1, so the output of `func_3` with arguments 1 and 1 is 2. Therefore, `fac[2]` is 2. The loop will continue to iterate and update `fac[i]` accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, 1 <= `k` <= `n`, list `a` is created from input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[1]` is 2, `i` is 2**
