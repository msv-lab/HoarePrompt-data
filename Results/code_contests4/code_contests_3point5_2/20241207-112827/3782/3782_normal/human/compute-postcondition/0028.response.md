Example Answer:
`ways` is updated by calling `func_2` with parameters `ways` and the result of `func_6(i + 1, k, fac)`. The previous values of `ways`, `i`, `k`, and `fac` are not provided, so the exact value of `ways` after this update is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, `ways` is updated by calling `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`, `i` is less than n, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i], a[i - 1])`, and `ways` is updated by calling `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i, k, fac)), `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i]).
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, `ways` is updated by calling `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))`, `i` is less than n, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i], a[i - 1])`, and `ways` is updated by calling `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i, k, fac)), `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])**
