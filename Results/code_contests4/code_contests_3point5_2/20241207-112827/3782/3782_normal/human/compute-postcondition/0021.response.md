Example Answer:
`ways` is assigned the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `fac` are already defined in the initial state, so the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)` will be the value returned by `func_6` using these parameters. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))` and is updated by calling `func_2` with parameters `ways`, `func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)`, `i` is less than n-1, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i])`, and now `ways` is assigned the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, `ways` is the result of `func_6(n, k, fac)` and is updated, `i` is less than n-1, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i)`**.
