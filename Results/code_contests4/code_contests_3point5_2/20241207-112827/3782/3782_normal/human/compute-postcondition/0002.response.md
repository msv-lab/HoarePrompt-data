Example Answer:
The list `fac` is created with a length of `n + 5`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n; list `a` is created from the input values.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n; list `a` is created from the input values**
