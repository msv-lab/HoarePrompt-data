Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is 0, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i]), `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac)), ways is updated by calling func_2 with parameters ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)`**
