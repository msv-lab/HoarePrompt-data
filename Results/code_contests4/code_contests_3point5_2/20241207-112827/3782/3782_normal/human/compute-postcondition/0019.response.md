According to the code, the loop will execute n-1 times, and the loop can execute again if the value of i is less than n-1 at the end of the previous iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i]), `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))` and is updated by calling `func_2` with parameters `ways`, `func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than n-1. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i + 1], a[i]), `ways` is the result of `func_2(ways, func_6(i + 1, k, fac))` and is updated by calling `func_2` with parameters `ways`, `func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)`, `i` is less than n-1**
