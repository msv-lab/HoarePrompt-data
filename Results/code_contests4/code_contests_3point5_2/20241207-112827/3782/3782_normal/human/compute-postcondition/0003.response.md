Example Answer:
`fac[0]` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n; list `a` is created from the input values, `fac[0]` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n; list `a` is created from the input values, `fac[0]` is 1**
