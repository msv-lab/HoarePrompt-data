Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= k <= n, `a` is sorted, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[i]` contains the result of `func_3` for each index `i` in the range 1 to n+4, `ans` is updated by calling `func_1` with parameters `ans` and the result of `func_3(diff, ways)`, where `diff` is the result of `func_2(a[i], a[i - 1]) for the last iteration, and `ways` is updated by calling `func_2(ways, func_6(n - i - 1, k, fac)) for the last iteration. The only action taken is to print the current value of `ans`.**
