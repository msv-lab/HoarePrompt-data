Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n, list `a` is created from the input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute, `fac[i]` is assigned the result of `func_3(fac[i - 1], i)` where `fac[i - 1]` is the previous value of `fac[i]` and `i` is the current iteration.**
