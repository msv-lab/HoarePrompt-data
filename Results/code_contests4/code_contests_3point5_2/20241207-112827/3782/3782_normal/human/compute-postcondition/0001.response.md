Example Answer:
The list `a` is created by taking input values and converting them to integers. The previous values of variables `n` and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n; list `a` is created from the input values.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n; list `a` is created from the input values**
