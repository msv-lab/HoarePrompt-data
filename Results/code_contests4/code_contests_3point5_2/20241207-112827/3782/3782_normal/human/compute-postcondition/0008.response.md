According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `n + 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, 1 <= `k` <= `n`, list `a` is created from input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[1]` is 2, and `i` is 2. Since the loop is executed for the first time, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, 1 <= `k` <= `n`, list `a` is created from input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `fac[1]` is 2, `i` is 3** for the loop to execute one more time.
