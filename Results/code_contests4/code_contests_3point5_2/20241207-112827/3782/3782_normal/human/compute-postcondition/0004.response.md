According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is within the range of 1 to n+5. Therefore, for the loop to execute, n and k being positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n is already satisfied. Before the loop starts, fac[0] is 1 is already given. In order to execute the loop, i needs to be set to 1 since the range starts at 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n, list `a` is created from the input values, `fac[0]` is 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute**
