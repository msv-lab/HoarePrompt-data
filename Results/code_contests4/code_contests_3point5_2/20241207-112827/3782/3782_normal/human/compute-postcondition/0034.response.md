Functionality: **The function `func_7` reads input values `N`, `K`, and a list of integers `A_i`. It calculates various values using helper functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_6`, and updates the variable `ans` in each iteration of the loop. The function then prints the final value of `ans`. However, the annotations suggest that the function deals with specific constraints and operations that are not explicitly present in the code, so the actual functionality might differ from what is described in the comments. Additionally, the function does not have any return value specified.**
