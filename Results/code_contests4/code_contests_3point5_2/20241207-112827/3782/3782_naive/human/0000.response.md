Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly implements the mathematical function described in the problem statement.
- It handles the input constraints and computes the answer modulo (10^9+7) as required.
- The program sorts the input array and calculates the difference between consecutive elements to find the sum of f(S) over all possible combinations of choosing K elements.
- The program calculates the factorials efficiently using pre-computation and modular arithmetic operations.
- The nested loops iterate over the array elements to calculate the ways of choosing K elements and the difference in the chosen elements.
- Finally, the program prints the correct answer modulo (10^9+7) as expected.
