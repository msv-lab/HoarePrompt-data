Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly implements the function to calculate the maximum and minimum of a set of integers, as well as the calculations needed to find the sum of f(S) over all possible ways of choosing K integers from the given set.
2. The program handles the input format specified in the problem description.
3. The program correctly calculates the answer modulo (10^9 + 7) as required.
4. The program uses functions to perform necessary calculations and uses dynamic programming to store factorial values efficiently.
5. The sorting of the input array 'a' ensures that the calculations for finding the differences between elements are correct.
6. The iteration to calculate the answer over all possible ways of choosing K integers is done correctly.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples.
