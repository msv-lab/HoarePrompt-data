The given program correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum possible sadness of Snuke based on the provided formula, and prints the result. The program iterates through each element in the list A, calculates the difference between A_i and (b+i), sorts the differences, and then calculates the minimum sadness by considering all possible splits of the sorted differences. It then prints the minimum sadness. 
The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output for the given examples. Thus, the program is correct.
