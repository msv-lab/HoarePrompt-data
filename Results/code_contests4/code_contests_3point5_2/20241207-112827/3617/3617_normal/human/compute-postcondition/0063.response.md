According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `line` is truthy, which means it must not be an empty string or None. At the end of the previous iteration, the minimum value of `m` is printed, and `line` is assigned the input read from stdin. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `line` read from stdin must not be an empty string to continue the loop. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The minimum value of `m` is printed, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin, for the loop to execute again `line` must not be an empty string**
