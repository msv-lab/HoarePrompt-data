According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value of `left`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `N + 1`, and `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 2`.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value of `left`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[i+2]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is equal to `i + 2` for the loop to execute the second time `j` must be less than `N + 1**.
