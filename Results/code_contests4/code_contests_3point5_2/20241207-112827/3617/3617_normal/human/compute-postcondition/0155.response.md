Example Answer: 
The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Since `j` is 2 and `i` is incremented by 1, the sum of absolute differences is calculated starting from the second element of `diff`. The loop will execute a third time when `i` becomes greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute a third time.
Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute a third time**
