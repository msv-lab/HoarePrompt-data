Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value converted from the input `line`. The minimum value in the updated list `m` will be printed, and for the loop to execute again, `line` must not be empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer value, the minimum value in the updated list `m` will be printed, `line` must not be empty for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`N` is an integer value, the minimum value in the updated list `m` will be printed, `line` must not be empty for the loop to execute again**
