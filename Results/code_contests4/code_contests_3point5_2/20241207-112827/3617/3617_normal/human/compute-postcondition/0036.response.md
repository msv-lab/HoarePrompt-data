According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables maintain their previous values, and `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. So for the next iteration, `j` needs to be `j + 1` and it should be less than `N`.
State: **All variables maintain their previous values, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be `j + 1` and `j` should be less than `N`**
