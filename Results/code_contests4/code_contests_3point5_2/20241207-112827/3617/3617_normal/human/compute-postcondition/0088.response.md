According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, and `left` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `right` is defined.
State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `right` is defined, for the loop to execute the first time**
