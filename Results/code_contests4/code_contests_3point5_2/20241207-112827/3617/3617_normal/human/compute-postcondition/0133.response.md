The value of `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous values of `left`, `diff[j]`, and `diff[i]` are considered. Since `left` is initially 0, the new value of `left` will be the absolute difference between the previous values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0.
