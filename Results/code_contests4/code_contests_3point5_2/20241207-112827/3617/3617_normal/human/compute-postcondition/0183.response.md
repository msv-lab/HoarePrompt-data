Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is N-1, `i` is N-2, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[N-1]` and `diff[N-2]` and all the previous differences, for the loop to execute all iterations `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` appends the sum of `left` and `right`**
