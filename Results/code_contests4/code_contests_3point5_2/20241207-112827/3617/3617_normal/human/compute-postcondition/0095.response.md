Example Answer:
`right` is assigned the value 0. This does not affect the other variables directly, but it resets the value of `right` to 0.
Output State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is updated based on the calculation `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `left` and `m` are modified, `i` is still greater than 0, `j` is `i-1`, `right` is 0**
