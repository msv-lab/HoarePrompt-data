According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is continuously updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is continuously updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be incremented by 1**
