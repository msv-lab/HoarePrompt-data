According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `N` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the condition for the loop to execute is that `N` is greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect `N` is greater than `i + 1`.
State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid combinations of `i` and `j`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the final value of `i` after all iterations, `right` is 0, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than `i + 1`**
