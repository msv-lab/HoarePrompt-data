Example Answer:
`right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` to its current value. The loop will execute one more time with `j` incremented by 1 as long as `j` is less than `N`. The values of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` are not known in the initial state, so the final value of `right` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables maintain their previous values, `right' is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be `j + 1` and `j` should be less than `N`.
Output State: **All variables maintain their previous values, `right' is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be `j + 1` and `j` should be less than `N**
