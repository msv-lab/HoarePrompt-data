According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be greater than or equal to 2 and `j` should be less than 2.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is greater than or equal to 2**
