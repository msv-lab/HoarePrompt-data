Example Answer:
The sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` is calculated and stored in `left`. Then, the sum of additional differences where the first element of the pair is fixed at index `i` and the second element ranges from `i+1` to `N-1` is calculated and stored in `right`. Finally, the sum of `left` and `right` is appended to list `m`. The values of `m` will be updated accordingly based on the calculations of `left` and `right`.
Output State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`**
