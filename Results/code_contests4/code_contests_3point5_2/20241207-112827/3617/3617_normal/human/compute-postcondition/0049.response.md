Example Answer: 
`left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the new value of `i`. 
Output State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the new value of `i`**
