Example Answer:
The value of `right` is incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, considering the previous values of `right`, `N`, `i`, and `j`. Since all variables maintain their previous values, the output state after execution is: All variables maintain their previous values, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.
Output State: **All variables maintain their previous values, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]**.
