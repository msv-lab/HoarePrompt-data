Example Answer:
The `right` variable is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the `diff` list. The `j` variable is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `N`. The previous values of the variables are maintained. 
Output State: **All variables maintain their previous values, `right` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `N`**
