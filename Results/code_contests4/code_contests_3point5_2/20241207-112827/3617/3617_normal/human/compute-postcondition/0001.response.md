According to the code, the loop continues as long as the condition `line` evaluates to True. Since `line` is the condition for the loop, we need to ensure that `line` evaluates to True to execute the loop one more time.

State: **`argv` is a list of integers with length N where 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= argv[i] <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N, for the loop to execute the first time `line` needs to evaluate to True**
