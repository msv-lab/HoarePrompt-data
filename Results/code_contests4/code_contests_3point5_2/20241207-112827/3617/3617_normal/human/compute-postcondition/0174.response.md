Output State: `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `right` is updated with the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `left` is recalculated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for every iteration of the loop. The final value of `left` will be the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` from index 0 to `N` and `right` will be the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` from index 1 to `N`.
