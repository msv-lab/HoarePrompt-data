Example Answer:
`left` is continuously updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The loop must be executed again by incrementing `j` by 1. The previous state of the variables is not mentioned, so the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is continuously updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be incremented by 1.
Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is continuously updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be incremented by 1**
