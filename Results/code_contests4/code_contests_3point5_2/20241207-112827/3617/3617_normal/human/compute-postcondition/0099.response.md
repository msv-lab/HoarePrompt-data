Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The values of `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, where `j` is updated to the new value of `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` and `right` are modified, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`.
Output State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` and `right` are modified, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`**
