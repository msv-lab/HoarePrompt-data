Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is i + 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `right` is updated based on the absolute difference between elements at indices `j` and `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is within the valid range**
