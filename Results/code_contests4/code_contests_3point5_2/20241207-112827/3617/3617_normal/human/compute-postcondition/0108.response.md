According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `right` have been updated. `i` is greater than 0, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
State: **`left` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is greater than 0 and incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, loop executes as long as `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`, `right` has been incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
