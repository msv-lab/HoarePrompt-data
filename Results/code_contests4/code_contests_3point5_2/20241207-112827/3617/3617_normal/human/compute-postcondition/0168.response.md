According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `N + 1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 0. 
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i - 1`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `right` is updated with the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `left` is 0, for the loop to execute `j` starts from 0**
