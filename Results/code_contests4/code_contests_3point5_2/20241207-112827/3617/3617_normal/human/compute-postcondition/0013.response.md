Output State: **`argv` is a list of integers with length N, `line` evaluates to True, `N` is an integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained by converting input elements to integers, `diff` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order after calculating the difference between each element in `A` and its index + 1, `m` is an empty list, `left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `N` is an integer such that `N >= i.**
