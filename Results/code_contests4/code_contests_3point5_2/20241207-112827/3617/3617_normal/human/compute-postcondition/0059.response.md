Example Answer: 
`m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`. The values of `left` and `right` are already updated with the described calculations. The loop has already executed `N - 1` times, so `i` and `j` have been updated accordingly. The condition for the loop to execute is also met. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by `N - 1`, `j` is equal to the final value of `i` after all iterations, `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than `i + 1, and `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`.
Output State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by `N - 1`, `j` is equal to the final value of `i` after all iterations, `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than `i + 1, and `m` is appended with the sum of `left` and `right`**
