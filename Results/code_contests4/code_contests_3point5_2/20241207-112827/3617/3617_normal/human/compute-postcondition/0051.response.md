Example Answer:
The variable `right` is assigned the value 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid combinations of `i` and `j`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the final value of `i` after all iterations, `right` is 0.
Output State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid combinations of `i` and `j`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the final value of `i` after all iterations, `right` is 0**
