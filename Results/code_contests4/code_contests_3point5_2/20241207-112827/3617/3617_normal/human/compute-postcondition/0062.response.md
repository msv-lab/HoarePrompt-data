Example Answer:
`line` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line from input and `rstrip('\n')` removes the newline character at the end. The minimum value of `m` is printed, and the value of `m` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: The minimum value of `m` is printed, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin.
Output State: **The minimum value of `m` is printed, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin**
