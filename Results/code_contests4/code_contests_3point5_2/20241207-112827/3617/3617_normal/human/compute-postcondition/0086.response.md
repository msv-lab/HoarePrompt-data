According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and `N` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, for the loop to execute another time `i` is increased by 1 and `N` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
