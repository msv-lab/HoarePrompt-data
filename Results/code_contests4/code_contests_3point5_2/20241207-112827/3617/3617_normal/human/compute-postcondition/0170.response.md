According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i - 1`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `right` is updated with the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `left` is recalculated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for every iteration of the loop. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `right` is updated with the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `left` is recalculated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for every iteration of the loop**.
