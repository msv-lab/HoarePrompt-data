According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is equal to `N`. For the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than `N`.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i - 1`, `i` is equal to `N + 1`, `right` is updated with the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element**
