According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is updated based on the calculation `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `left` and `m` are modified, `i` is still greater than 0, `j` is 0, `right` is defined. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is updated based on the calculation `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `left` and `m` are modified, `i` is still greater than 0, `j` is 1, `right` is defined**
