According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `left` and `right` have been modified, `i` is increased by `N-1`, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, and `right` has been incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for each iteration. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated value of `i` should be less than `N`. Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `left` and `right` have been modified, `i` is increased by `N`, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, loop executes as long as `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`, `right` has been incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
