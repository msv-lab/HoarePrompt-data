Example Answer:
The value of `right` is updated to 0. Since `right` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, and there are no elements in `diff` yet, the sum is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `right` is 0, and `left` is recalculated based on `diff`.
Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `right` is 0, and `left` is recalculated based on `diff`**
