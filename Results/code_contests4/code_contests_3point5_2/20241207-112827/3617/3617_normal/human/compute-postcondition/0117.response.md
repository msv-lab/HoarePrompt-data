Output State: `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between all `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range [0, i), `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to N, `j` is N + 1, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than N.
