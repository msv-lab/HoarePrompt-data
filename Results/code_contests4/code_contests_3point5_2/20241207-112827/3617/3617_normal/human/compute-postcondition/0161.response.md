Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is recalculated based on `diff`, `j` is the next value after `i - 1`, `i` is equal to `N`, `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between elements at positions `i` and `j`, with `j` ranging from `i + 1` to `N` for the loop to execute one more time**
