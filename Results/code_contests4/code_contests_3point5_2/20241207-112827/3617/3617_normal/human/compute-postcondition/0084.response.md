Output State: **`m` is an empty list, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin and is not an empty string, `N` is an integer value greater than 0, `A` is a list containing integers parsed from the input string, `diff` is a sorted list containing the result of each element in list `A` subtracted by its index incremented by 1, `left` is the sum of the absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `i` is less than `N`, `j` is equal to `N-1`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` where the first element of the pair is fixed at index `i` and the second element ranges from `i+1` to `N-1`**
