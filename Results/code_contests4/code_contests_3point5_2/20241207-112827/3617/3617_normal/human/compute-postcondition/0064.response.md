Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value of `line`, which is read from stdin. The minimum value of `m` is printed, and for the loop to execute again, `line` must not be an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: The minimum value of `m` is printed, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin, for the loop to execute again `line` must not be an empty string, `N` is an integer value.
Output State: **The minimum value of `m` is printed, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin, for the loop to execute again `line` must not be an empty string, `N` is an integer value**
