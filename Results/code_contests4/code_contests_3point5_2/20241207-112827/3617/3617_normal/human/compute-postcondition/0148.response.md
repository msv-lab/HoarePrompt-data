According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is equal to `N`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `N` remains the same.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is equal to `N`, `i` is incremented by 1**
