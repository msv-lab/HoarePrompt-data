Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`. `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, and `right` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element. As `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, the output state would be: `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is equal to `N`.
Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of all absolute differences between pairs of elements in `diff` starting from the second element, `j` is equal to `N`**
