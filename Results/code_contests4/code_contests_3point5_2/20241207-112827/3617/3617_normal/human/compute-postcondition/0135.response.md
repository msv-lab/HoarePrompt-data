Example Answer:
`left` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The initial state specifies that `left` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, and `i` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the second time. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is continuously updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`.
Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is continuously updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
