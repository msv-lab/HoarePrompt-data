Example Answer:
The value of `left` remains unchanged and `right` is updated by adding `left` and `right` and then appending it to the list `m`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid combinations of `i` and `j`, and it is appended to the list `m`.
Output State: **All variables maintain their previous values, `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all valid combinations of `i` and `j`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`**
