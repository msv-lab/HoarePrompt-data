According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between all `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range [0, i), `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to N, `j` is N + 1, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than `N`.
State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between all `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range [0, i), `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to N, `j` is N, `right` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than N**
