According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than the updated value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is updated, `m` contains the updated sum, `i` is greater than 0 and incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, loop executes as long as `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`, `right` has been incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the updated value of `i` after the previous iteration.
State: **`left` is updated with the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is greater than 0 and incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the new value of `i`, loop executes as long as `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`, `right` has been incremented by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the updated value of `i`**
