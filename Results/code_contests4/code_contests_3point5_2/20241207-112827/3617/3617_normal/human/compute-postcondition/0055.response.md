Output State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 2, `j` is equal to the final value of `i` after all iterations, `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than `i + 1, `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`**
