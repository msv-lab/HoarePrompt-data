According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than the new value of `i`.
State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the new value of `i`**
