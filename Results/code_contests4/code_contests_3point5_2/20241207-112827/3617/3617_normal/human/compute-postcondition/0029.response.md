Output State: **`argv` is a list of integers with length N, `line` evaluates to True, `N` is an integer such that `N >= i+2`, `A` is a list of integers obtained by converting input elements to integers, `diff` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order after calculating the difference between each element in `A` and its index + 1, `m` contains the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` and the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff` for the entire range of j from i+1 to N, `left` is assigned the value equal to the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all `j` in the range `i+1` to `N`, `i` is a positive integer for the loop to execute a second time**
