According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is an empty list, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin and is not an empty string, `N` is an integer value greater than 0, `A` is a list containing integers parsed from the input string, `diff` is a sorted list containing the result of each element in list `A` subtracted by its index incremented by 1, `left` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `i` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`m` is an empty list, `line` is assigned the input read from stdin and is not an empty string, `N` is an integer value greater than 0, `A` is a list containing integers parsed from the input string, `diff` is a sorted list containing the result of each element in list `A` subtracted by its index incremented by 1, `left` is increased by the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1**
