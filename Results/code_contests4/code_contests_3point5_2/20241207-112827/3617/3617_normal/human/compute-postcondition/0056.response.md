According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 2, `j` is equal to the final value of `i` after all iterations, `right` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `N` is greater than `i + 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `N` must be greater than `i + 3`.
