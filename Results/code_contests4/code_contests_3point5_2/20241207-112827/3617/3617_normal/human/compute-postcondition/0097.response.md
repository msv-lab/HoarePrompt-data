Output State: `m` is a list containing the sum of `left` and `right`, `left` is updated based on the calculation `left += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, `left`, `right`, and `m` are modified, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `i-1`, `right` is updated based on the calculation `right += abs(diff[j] - diff[i])`, for the loop to execute `N` is greater than the updated value of `i`, and the relationship between `i` and `j` is correctly set.
