According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` is greater than or equal to 1 ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. The minimum value in the updated list `m` to be printed indicates that the list `m` needs to be updated before the loop starts. Since `left` is 0 before the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `m` is updated with the minimum value, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value, `left` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than 0**.
