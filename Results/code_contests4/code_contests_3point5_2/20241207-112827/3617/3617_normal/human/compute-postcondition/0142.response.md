According to the code, in order for the loop to execute again, the variable `j` must be less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value of `left`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `N + 1`.
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 2, `line` is not empty, `m` is updated with the minimum value of `left`, `left` is the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in `diff`, `right` is the sum of absolute differences between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `j` is equal to `i + 1` for the loop to execute the second time `j` must be less than `N + 1`**
