Example Answer:
`line` is assigned the value of the input read from standard input with the newline character removed. The variable `argv` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `argv` is a list of integers with length N where 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= argv[i] <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **`argv` is a list of integers with length N where 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= argv[i] <= 10^9 for 1 <= i <= N**
