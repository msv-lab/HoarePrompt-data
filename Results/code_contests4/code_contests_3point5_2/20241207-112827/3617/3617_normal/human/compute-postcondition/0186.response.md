Example Answer:
`line` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`. The value of `line` depends on the input from the standard input, which is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: Minimum value of `m` is printed, `line` is assigned the input value from standard input after removing the newline character.
Output State: **Minimum value of `m` is printed, `line` is assigned the input value from standard input after removing the newline character**
