Example Answer:
The `left` variable is updated by adding the absolute difference between `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`. The previous values of `left`, `m`, `i`, and `j` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between pairs of `diff[j]` and `diff[i]`, `m` contains the updated value of `right`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
