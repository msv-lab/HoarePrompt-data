According to the code, the loop can execute if `N` is greater than `i + 1` because `j` starts from `i + 1`. Before the loop starts, `left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between all `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range [0, i) ensures that the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `right` is 0. So for the loop to be executed the first time, `N` is greater than `i + 1`, `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is greater than 0 and equal to `N`, `j` is updated to the new value of `i` + 1.
State: **`left` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between all `diff[j]` and `diff[i]` for all j in the range [0, i), `m` contains the updated sum of `left` and `right`, `i` is equal to N, `j` is i + 1, `right` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than i + 1**
