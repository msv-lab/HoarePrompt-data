According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `line`. If `line` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the code prints the minimum value in the updated list `m`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `line` needs to be adjusted to be not empty after the last iteration.
State: **The code prints the minimum value in the updated list `m`, for the loop to execute again `line` is not empty**
