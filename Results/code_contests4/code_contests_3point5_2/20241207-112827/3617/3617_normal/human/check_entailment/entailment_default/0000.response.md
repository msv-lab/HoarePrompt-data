Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is trying to calculate the minimum possible sadness of Snuke based on the absolute differences between the elements of the input array and their corresponding indices adjusted by an arbitrary integer b. However, the code implementation is incorrect. 

The issue lies in the calculation of the `m` list. The code calculates the sum of absolute differences between the elements that are at different positions in the sorted array `diff`. This approach is incorrect as it does not consider the correct positions of the elements in the original array. Thus, the code does not provide the correct minimum sadness of Snuke.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
