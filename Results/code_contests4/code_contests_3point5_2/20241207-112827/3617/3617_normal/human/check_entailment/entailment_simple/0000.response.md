Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program reads input from `sys.stdin` using `sys.stdin.readline()` and `raw_input()`, which are not valid in Python. Additionally, the program does not calculate the minimum possible sadness of Snuke as described in the problem. The calculations performed in the program differ from the required calculations in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
