Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program reads input incorrectly using `sys.stdin.readline()` and `raw_input()`, which are not valid for reading input in Python. Additionally, the calculation of the minimum possible sadness of Snuke is not correctly implemented in the program. The logic for calculating `m` inside the nested loops is incorrect and does not match the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the correctness is deemed as False.
