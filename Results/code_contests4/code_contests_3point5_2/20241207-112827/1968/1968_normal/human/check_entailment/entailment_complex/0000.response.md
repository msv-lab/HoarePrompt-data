Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It processes each test case by sorting the players tokens, then uses a binary search algorithm to find the index of the last player with non-zero probability of winning. It then prints the number of players with non-zero probability and their corresponding indices. The program handles all test cases as described in the problem statement.
