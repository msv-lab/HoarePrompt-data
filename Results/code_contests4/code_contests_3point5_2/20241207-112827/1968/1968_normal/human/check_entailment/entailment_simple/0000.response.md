Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case according to the rules of the championship described in the problem, and outputs the number of players who have a nonzero probability of winning and their corresponding numbers. It uses binary search to efficiently determine the number of players with a chance of winning.

The implementation ensures that the last player with non-zero tokens is considered the winner of the championship, which aligns with the problem description. The logic used to determine which players have a chance of winning is correct and follows the rules provided.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
