Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `ans` is `n`, `out` contains the updated values from `n` to `n` joined as a string separated by spaces, `md` is half of `n`, `su` is -1, `i` is `md + 1`. The sum of elements in `a` up to the middle index of the list `a` is less than `a[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
