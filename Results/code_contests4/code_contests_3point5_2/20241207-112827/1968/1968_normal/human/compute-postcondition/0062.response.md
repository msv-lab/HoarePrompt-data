Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, where `md` is the midpoint. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans` is updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i` remain the same.
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans` is updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i` remain the same**
