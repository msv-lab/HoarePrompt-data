According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `n` is the first input value. To execute the loop the first time, `be` should be less than or equal to `en`, so no adjustments are needed for `be`. However, since `en` is `n - 1`, to execute the loop the first time, `en` should be greater than or equal to `be`, which implies `n - 1` should be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n` should be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is the first input value, `a` is the sorted list of the rest of the inputs, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
