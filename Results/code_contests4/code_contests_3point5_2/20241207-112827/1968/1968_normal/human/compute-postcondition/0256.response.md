Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, where `md` is the middle index of the list `a`. The value of `md` is not given, so the output state is: If `su` is not -1, then `su` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1`, if the loop completes without breaking. If `su` is -1, it remains -1; `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`.
Output State: **If `su` is not -1, then `su` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1`, if the loop completes without breaking. If `su` is -1, it remains -1; `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`, `ans` is assigned the value of `md + 1`**
