Example Answer:
The lambda function rints_2d is defined to take an input n, and then create a 2D list by calling the lambda function rints n times to read integers from standard input. Since the initial state does not specify the values of n or the input values, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list, rints_2d is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by reading integers from standard input n times.**
