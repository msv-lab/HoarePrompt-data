Example Answer:
`rstr` is assigned a lambda function that reads a line from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a_i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n**
