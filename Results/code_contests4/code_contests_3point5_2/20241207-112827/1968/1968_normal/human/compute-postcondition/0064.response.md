According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for `su` being -1 or not have already been checked and updated accordingly. So, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute again is `be`. It needs to be updated to `be` is less than `en`.
State: **`n`, `a`, `be` is less than `en`, `en`, and `ans` are as described in the precondition. If the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than any element after the midpoint, then `su` is -1. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end. If `su` is -1, then `su` remains -1 and `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. If `su` is not -1, then `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, and `ans` are updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i` remain the same**
