Example Answer:
`en` is assigned the value `md - 1`. The values of `md`, `n`, and `su` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact values of `en`. Therefore, the Output State is: *If su is not -1, then su will be the sum of all elements in the list a from index md + 1 to n-1, if the loop completes without breaking. If su is -1, it remains -1; `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`.
Output State: ***If su is not -1, then su will be the sum of all elements in the list a from index md + 1 to n-1, if the loop completes without breaking. If su is -1, it remains -1; `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`***
