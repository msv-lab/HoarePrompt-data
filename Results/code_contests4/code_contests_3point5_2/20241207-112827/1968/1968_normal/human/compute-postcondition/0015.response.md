According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is (n - 1) / 2, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to the midpoint. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to `md + 1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is (n - 1) / 2, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to the midpoint, `i` is md + 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 1**
