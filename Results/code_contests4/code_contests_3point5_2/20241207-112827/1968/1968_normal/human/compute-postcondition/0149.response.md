Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of `be + en >> 1`, where `>>` is a right shift operator. The previous values of `be` and `en` are unknown, so the output state is: `be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers, for the loop to execute again `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`.
Output State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers, for the loop to execute again `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`**
