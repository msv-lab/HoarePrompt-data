Example Answer:
The value of `su` remains -1 as there is no code that affects its value. The program directly breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`su` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
