Output State: **`n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 2`, `a` is the list of inputs, `be` is 0, `en` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `n`, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to the index `md` plus the element at index `i`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is set to -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `su` is updated by adding the element at index `i` in list `a`.**
