Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `su` is -1, `be` is 0, `en` is half of `n` minus 1, `ans` is half of `n` plus 1, `out` contains the updated values from `n` to `n` joined as a string separated by spaces, `md` is half of `n`, `su` is -1, `i` is equal to `n` and for the loop to execute again `be` is less than `en`, `md` is updated to the result of `be + en` right shifted by 1.**
