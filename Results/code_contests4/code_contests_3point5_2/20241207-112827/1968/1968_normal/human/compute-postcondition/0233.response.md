Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of `(be + en) >> 1`. The value of `be` and `en` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `md`. Therefore, the Output State is: If `su` is -1, the program state remains the same. If `su` is not -1, for the loop to execute again `md - 1` needs to be greater than `md + 1`.
Output State: **If `su` is -1, the program state remains the same. If `su` is not -1, for the loop to execute again `md - 1` needs to be greater than `md + 1**.
