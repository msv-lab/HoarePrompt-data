Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value returned by `rint()`, which reads an integer from standard input. `a` is assigned the sorted list returned by `rints()`, which reads integers from standard input and converts them to a list. Therefore, after execution, `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a sorted list of positive integers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers**
