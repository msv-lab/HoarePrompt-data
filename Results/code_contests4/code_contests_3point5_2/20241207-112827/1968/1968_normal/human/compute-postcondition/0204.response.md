Output State: **If su is always greater or equal to a[i] for all i in the range(md+1, n), then su will be the sum of all elements in list a up to index n-1. Otherwise, su will be -1. Additionally, n will remain the same, i will be n, a will be the list of inputs, be will be 0, en will be md - 1, ans will be md + 1, and md will be the floor division of the sum of be and en by 2. Moreover, su is not equal to -1.**
