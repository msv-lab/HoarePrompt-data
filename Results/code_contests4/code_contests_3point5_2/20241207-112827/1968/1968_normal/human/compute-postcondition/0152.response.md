Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n`, `su` are integers. `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`, `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than `md + 1`, `i` is `md + 1. After entering the if condition, `su` is less than element `a[i]`***
