Output State: **If the sum of elements from index 0 to `md` (inclusive) in the list `a` is less than the value at index `i`, `su` is assigned -1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `su` is incremented by the value at index `i`, with no changes to the variables `be`, `en`, and `md`.**
