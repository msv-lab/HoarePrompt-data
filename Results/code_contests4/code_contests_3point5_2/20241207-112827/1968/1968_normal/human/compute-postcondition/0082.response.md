Output State: 
- If `su` is -1: `su` remains -1, `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`.
- If `su` is not -1 and `su` is less than `a[i]`: `su`, `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, and `ans` are updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i`, `md`, and `i` remain the same. Additionally, `su` remains -1, `be` is `md + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
