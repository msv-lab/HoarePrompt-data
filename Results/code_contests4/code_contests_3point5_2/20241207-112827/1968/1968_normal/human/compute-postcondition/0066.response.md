Output State: **If the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than any element after the midpoint, then `su` is -1. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end. If `su` is -1, then `su` remains -1 and `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. If `su` is not -1, then `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, and `ans` are updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i` remain the same.**
