Postcondition: ***If `su` is -1, the program state remains the same with `n`, `i`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `su` retaining their initial values. The loop will not execute. If `su` is not -1, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n`, `a` is the list of inputs, `be` is either 0 or `md+1`, `en` is `md - 1`, `ans` is updated to `md + 1`, `md` is the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, and the loop will not execute.***
