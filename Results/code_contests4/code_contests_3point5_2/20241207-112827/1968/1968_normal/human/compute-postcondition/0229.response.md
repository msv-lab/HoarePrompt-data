Output State: If `su` remains -1, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n`, `a` is the list of inputs, `be` is either 0 or `md+1`, `en` is `md - 1`, `ans` is `n` or `md+1`, `md` is the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, `su` is the sum of elements from index 0 to `md` (inclusive) in the list `a`, and the loop will not execute. Additionally, `su` is not equal to -1.
