Example Answer:
`be`, `en`, and `ans` are assigned the values 0, n - 1, and n respectively. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, and `ans` is n. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n**
