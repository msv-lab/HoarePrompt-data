Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is (n - 1) / 2, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to the midpoint plus the element at index `i`, `i` is md + 2. If the sum of elements in `a` up to the midpoint plus the element at index `i` is less than `a[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.**
