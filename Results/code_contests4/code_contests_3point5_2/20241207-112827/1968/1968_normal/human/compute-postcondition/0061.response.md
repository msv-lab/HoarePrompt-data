Output State: **`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `i` are as described in the precondition. If the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than any element after the midpoint, then `su` is -1. Otherwise, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end. If the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is not less than any element after the midpoint, then `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end. `en` is assigned the value of `md - 1`.**
