According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `md`, `su`, and elements in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `su` is increased by the value of `a[i]`, `n` is greater than `md + 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than `md + 1` and `su` must be less than `a[i]`.
State: **su is increased by the value of a[i], n is still greater than md + 1, and su is less than a[i] for the loop to execute another time**
