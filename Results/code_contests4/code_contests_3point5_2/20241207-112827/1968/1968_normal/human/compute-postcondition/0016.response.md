Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is (n - 1) / 2, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` up to the midpoint, `i` is md + 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 1. The sum of elements in `a` up to the midpoint is less than the element at index `i`***
