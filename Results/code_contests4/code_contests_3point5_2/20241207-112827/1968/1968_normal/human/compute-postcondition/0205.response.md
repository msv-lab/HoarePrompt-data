Postcondition: ***If su is -1, then su remains -1 and the variables n, i, a, be, en, ans, and md stay the same. If su is not -1, then su is either the sum of all elements in list a up to index n-1 or -1 based on whether su is always greater or equal to a[i] for all i in the range(md+1, n). Additionally, n remains the same, i is n, a is the list of inputs, be is either 0 or md+1, en is either n-1 or md-1, ans is n or md+1, and md is the floor division of the sum of be and en by 2.***
