Example Answer:
The lambda function `rstr_2d` takes an input `n` and creates a 2D list of random strings by calling the function `rstr()` `n` times. Since the function `rstr()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact output. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n**
