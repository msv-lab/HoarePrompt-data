Example Answer:
The lambda function `rstrs` reads a line from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings. The function then converts each element in the list to a string. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n**
