Output State: If su is -1, then su remains -1, n remains the same, i is n, a is the list of inputs, be is either 0 or md+1, en is either n-1 or md-1, ans is n or md+1, md is the floor division of the sum of be and en by 2, and for the loop to execute again be is less than or equal to en, md is assigned the value of be + en right-shifted by 1, su is assigned the sum of elements from index 0 to md (inclusive) in the list a.
