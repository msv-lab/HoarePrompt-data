Postcondition: ***Output State: If `su` is -1, `su` remains -1 and `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. If `su` is not -1 and `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su`, `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, and `ans` are updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i`, `md`, and `i` remain the same. Additionally, `su` remains -1, `be` is `md + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `su` is not -1 and `su` is not less than `a[i]`, `su` is equal to the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end. `n` is updated to `md + 1`, `a` remains the same, `be` is updated to `md`, `en` is updated to `md - 1`, and `ans` is updated to `md + 1`.***
