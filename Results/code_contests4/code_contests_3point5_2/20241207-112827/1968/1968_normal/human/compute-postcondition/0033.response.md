Example Answer:
`be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`, where `md` is calculated as `(n - 1) / 2`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `md` will be calculated as a positive integer. Therefore, `be` will be a positive integer as well. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is a positive integer, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is a positive integer, `su` is -1 if the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than any element after the midpoint**
