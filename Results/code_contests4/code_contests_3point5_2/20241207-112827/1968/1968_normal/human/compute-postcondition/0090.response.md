Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is equal to `ans`, `en` is less than `be`, `ans` is the index of the element in `a` where the sum of elements from that index to the end is less than any element after that index, `md` is the index of the mid-point element in the current subarray being considered, `su` is -1 if the sum of elements in `a` from the mid-point to the end is less than any element after the mid-point, otherwise `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the mid-point to the end.
