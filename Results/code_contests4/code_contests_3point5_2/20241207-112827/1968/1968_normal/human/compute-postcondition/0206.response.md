According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of variables `be` and `en` are determined by the values of `md` and `n`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `be` and `en` need to be adjusted based on the value of `md`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If su is -1, then su remains -1, n remains the same, i is n, a is the list of inputs, be is either 0 or md+1, en is either n-1 or md-1, ans is n or md+1, and md is the floor division of the sum of be and en by 2, and for the loop to execute again be is less than or equal to en**
