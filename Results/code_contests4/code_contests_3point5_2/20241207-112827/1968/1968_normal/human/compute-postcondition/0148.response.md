According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers. For the loop to execute again, `be` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `en`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers, for the loop to execute again `be` is less than or equal to `en`**
