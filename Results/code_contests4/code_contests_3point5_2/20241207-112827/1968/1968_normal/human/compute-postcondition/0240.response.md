Example Answer:
`su` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. The previous value of `su` is not known, but `su` is not -1. Therefore, the new value of `su` is `su + a[i]`. The loop will continue to run as long as `n` is greater than `md + 1`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. 
Output State: **`su` is increased by the value of `a[i]`. The loop will continue to run as long as `n` is greater than `md + 1` and if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.**
