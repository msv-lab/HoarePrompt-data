The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases specified by the parameter constraints. For each test case, the function will receive an integer n followed by n positive integers a_i. The function will then process each test case and return the desired output based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n positive integers a_i. The function will return the desired output for each test case.**
