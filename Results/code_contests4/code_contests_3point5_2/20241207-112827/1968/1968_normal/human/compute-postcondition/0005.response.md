Example Answer:
The lambda function `rint_2d` takes a positive integer `n` as input and creates a 2D list by reading `n` integers from standard input using the lambda function `rint()`. Since the initial state does not mention the existence of the `rint()` function, we cannot determine the exact values in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list**
