Example Answer:
`en` is assigned the value `md - 1`. The previous values of `md` are known, but the values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers. `su` is either the sum of the elements from index `md + 1` to `n` in list `a` or does not exceed the value of `a[i]` at any point during the loop execution. `en` is assigned the value `md - 1`.
