Postcondition: ***If the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than any element after the midpoint and `su` is -1, then `su` remains -1 and `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. Otherwise, if `su` is not -1 and `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, and `ans` are updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i` remain the same. For the loop to execute, `md` is lesser than `n`***
