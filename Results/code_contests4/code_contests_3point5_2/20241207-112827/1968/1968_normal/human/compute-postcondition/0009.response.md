According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input provided by the user. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `a_i` is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `rints` is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list, `rints_2d` is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by reading integers from standard input n times, the input provided by the user should be a positive integer.**
