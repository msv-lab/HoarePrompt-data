According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than `md + 1`. If `su` is not -1, the loop will execute again only if `md - 1` is greater than `md + 1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`su` is not -1, `md` is an integer, `n` is greater than `md + 1` for the loop to execute**.
