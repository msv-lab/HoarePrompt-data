Example Answer:
`be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. The previous value of `md` is unknown, so the output state is: `If su is -1, then su is -1. n, i, a, be, en, ans, and md remain the same as described in the precondition, be is assigned the value of md + 1`.
Output State: **If su is -1, then su is -1. n, i, a, be, en, ans, and md remain the same as described in the precondition, be is assigned the value of md + 1**
