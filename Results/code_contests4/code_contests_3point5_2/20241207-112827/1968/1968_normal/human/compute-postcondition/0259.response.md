Output State: **If `su` is -1, then `su` remains -1 and the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, and `md` stay the same. If `su` is not -1, then `su` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a` from index `md + 1` to `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking. Additionally, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n`, `a` is the list of inputs, `be` is either 0 or `md+1`, `en` is either `n-1` or `md-1`, `ans` is the index where the sum is valid, and `md` is the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2. `out` appends the value `n - ans + 1`.**
