According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is either 0 or `md+1`, and `en` is `md - 1`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `be` needs to be less than `en`. Since `be` is either 0 or `md+1`, and `en` is `md - 1`, `md-1` needs to be greater than `md+1` for the loop to execute again.
State: **If `su` is -1, the program state remains the same. If `su` is not -1, for the loop to execute again `md - 1` needs to be greater than `md + 1`.**
