Example Answer: 
`rints` is assigned a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list**
