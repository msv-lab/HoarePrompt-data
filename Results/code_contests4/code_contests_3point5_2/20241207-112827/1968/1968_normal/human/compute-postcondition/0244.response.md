Postcondition: ***su is increased by the value of a[i]. n is still greater than md + 1, and su is less than a[i] for the loop to execute another time. If su < a[i], su is assigned the value -1 but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
