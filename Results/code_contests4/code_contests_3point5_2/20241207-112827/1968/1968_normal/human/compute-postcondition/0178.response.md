Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the first input, and `a` is assigned the sorted list of the rest of the inputs. The values of the other variables are not specified, so the Output State is: `n` is the first input value, `a` is the sorted list of the rest of the inputs.
Output State: **`n` is the first input value, `a` is the sorted list of the rest of the inputs**
