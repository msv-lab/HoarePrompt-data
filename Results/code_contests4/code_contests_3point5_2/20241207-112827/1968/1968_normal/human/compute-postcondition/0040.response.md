Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is a positive integer less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is either n or md + 1, `md` is the midpoint between `be` and `en`, `su` is -1 if the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than any element after the midpoint, otherwise `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the beginning to the midpoint.**
