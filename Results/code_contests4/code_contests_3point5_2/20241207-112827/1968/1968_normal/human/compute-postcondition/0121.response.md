Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers. If `su` is -1, then `be` is half of `n` plus 1, `en` is `n`, `ans` is `n`, `out` contains the updated values from `n` to `n` joined as a string separated by spaces, `md` is half of `n`, `su` is -1, `i` is equal to `n`. If `su` is not -1, then `be` is 0, `en` is half of `n` minus 1, `ans` is half of `n` plus 1.***
