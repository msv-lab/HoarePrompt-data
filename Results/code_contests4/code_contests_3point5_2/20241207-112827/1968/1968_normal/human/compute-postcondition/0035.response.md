The value of `en` is assigned `md - 1`, where `md` is `(n - 1) / 2`. Since `md` is the midpoint of the list `a`, subtracting 1 from `md` moves the endpoint `en` to the left of the midpoint. Therefore, the new value of `en` is `md - 1`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is md - 1, `ans` is n, `md` is (n - 1) / 2, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end and it is not -1**
