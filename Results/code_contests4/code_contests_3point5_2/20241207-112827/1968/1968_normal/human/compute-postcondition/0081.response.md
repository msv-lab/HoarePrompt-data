Postcondition: ***If `su` is -1, `su` remains -1 and `be` is assigned the value of `md + 1`. If `su` is not -1, `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, and `ans` are updated to `md + 1`, `md`, and `i` remain the same. Additionally, if `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` remains -1, `be` is `md + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
