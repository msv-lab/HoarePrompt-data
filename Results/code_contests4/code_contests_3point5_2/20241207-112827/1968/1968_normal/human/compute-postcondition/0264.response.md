Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n positive integers a_i. For each test case, it performs a binary search algorithm to find a specific value based on the input array and returns the desired output for each test case. The function utilizes lambda functions for input/output operations and binary search logic to determine the final output per test case. **
