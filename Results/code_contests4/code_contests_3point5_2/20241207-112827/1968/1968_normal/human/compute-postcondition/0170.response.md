Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers. `be` is less than or equal to `en`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`. `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`. If `su` is less than any of the elements in `a` starting from index `md + 1` onwards, then `su` is assigned the value -1. Additionally, `su` does not equal -1***
