Postcondition: ***`be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n`, `su` are integers. `be` is less than or equal to `en`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`. `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`. If `su` is less than any of the elements in `a` starting from index `md + 1` onwards, then `su` is assigned the value -1. If `su` is equal to -1, then `be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers. `be` is equal to `md + 1`, `su` is equal to -1. If `su` is not -1, then `be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n`, `su` are integers. `be` is less than or equal to `en`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`. `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`. If `su` is less than any of the elements in `a` starting from index `md + 1` onwards, then `su` is assigned the value -1. Additionally, `su` does not equal -1. `en` is now assigned the value of `md - 1, `ans` is assigned the value `md + 1`.***
