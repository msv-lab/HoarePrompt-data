According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `md`, `su`, and `a[i]`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `su` is increased by the value of `a[i]`, `n` is still greater than `md + 1`, and `su` is less than `a[i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `su` needs to be less than `a[i]`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is assigned the value -1, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
State: **su is -1, n is still greater than md + 1, su is less than a[i] for the loop to execute another time**
