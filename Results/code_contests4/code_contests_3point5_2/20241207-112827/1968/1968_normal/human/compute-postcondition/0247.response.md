Example Answer:
`su` is assigned the value -1. The value of `su` is now -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: su is -1, n is still greater than md + 1, su is less than a[i] for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **su is -1, n is still greater than md + 1, su is less than a[i] for the loop to execute another time**
