According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `md`, and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `i` remain the same. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, `su` is updated to -1 and the loop or if statement is exited. `su` is incremented by `a[i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `a`, `be`, `en`, `ans`, `md`, and `i + 1` remain the same**
