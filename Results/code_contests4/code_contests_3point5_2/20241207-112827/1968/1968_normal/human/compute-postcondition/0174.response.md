If `su` is -1, `be` is the index to the right of the middle index of the list `a`, `en` is `n`, `ans` is `n`, `out` contains the updated values from `n` to `n` joined as a string separated by spaces. If `su` is not -1, `be` is 0, `en` is the index to the left of the middle index of the list `a`, `ans` is the middle index of the list `a`.**
