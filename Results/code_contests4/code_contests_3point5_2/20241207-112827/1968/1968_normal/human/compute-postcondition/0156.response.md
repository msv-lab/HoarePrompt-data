Output State: **`be`, `en`, `ans`, `out`, `i`, `md`, `n` are integers. `be` is less than or equal to `en`, and `md` is calculated based on `be` and `en`. `su` is the sum of elements in list `a` up to index `md + 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than `md + 1` and `i` is set to `md + 1`. If `su` is less than `a[i]`, then `su` is assigned the value -1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `su` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`.**
