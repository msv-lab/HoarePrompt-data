Example Answer:
The lambda function `ceil1` takes two input parameters `a` and `b` and calculates `(a + b - 1) // b`, which essentially calculates the ceiling division of `a` by `b`. The lambda function `out` is an empty list. Since the lambda functions are only defined and not executed, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a_i`, `rints`, and `rints_2d` remains unchanged.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list, rints_2d is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by reading integers from standard input n times**
