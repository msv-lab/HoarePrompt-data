According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `be` and `en`. If `be` is less than or equal to `en`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `be` is a positive integer and `en` is n - 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `be` needs to be updated to be less than `en`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is a positive integer less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is either n or md + 1, `md` is a positive integer, `su` is -1 if the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than any element after the midpoint, otherwise `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end**
