Example Answer:
`md` is assigned the value of the result of `be + en >> 1`. The value of `be` is 0, the value of `en` is `n`, so `md` is `n >> 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the value of `n >> 1` is half of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `ans` is `n`, `out` contains the updated values from `n` to `n` joined as a string separated by spaces, `md` is half of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `ans` is `n`, `out` contains the updated values from `n` to `n` joined as a string separated by spaces, `md` is half of `n`**
