Output State: **`su` is -1, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n`, `a` is the list of inputs, `be` is either 0 or `md+1`, `en` is either `n-1` or `md-1`, `ans` is `n` or `md+1`, `md` is the floor division of the sum of `be` and `en` by 2, for the loop to execute again `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `md` is assigned the value of `be + en` right-shifted by 1, `su` is assigned the sum of elements from index 0 to `md` (inclusive) in the list `a`. Additionally, `su` is less than the element at index `n` in list `a`**
