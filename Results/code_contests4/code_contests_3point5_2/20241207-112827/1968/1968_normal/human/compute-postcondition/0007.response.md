Example Answer:
The lambda function `pr` takes two arguments `args` (a list of integers) and `sep` (a separator) and writes the elements of `args` separated by `sep` to the standard output followed by a new line. The function does not modify any existing variables. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list, rints_2d is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by reading integers from standard input n times.
Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, a_i is a positive integer for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, rints is a lambda function that reads integers from standard input and converts them to integer values in a list, rints_2d is a lambda function that creates a 2D list by reading integers from standard input n times**
