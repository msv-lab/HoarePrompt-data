Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is a positive integer less than `en`, `en` is n - 1, `ans` is either n or md + 1, `md` is the midpoint between `be` and `en`, `su` is -1, `su` is the sum of elements in `a` from the beginning to the midpoint, for the loop to execute `md + 1` is less than `n`, and the sum of elements in `a` from the midpoint to the end is less than `a[i']**
