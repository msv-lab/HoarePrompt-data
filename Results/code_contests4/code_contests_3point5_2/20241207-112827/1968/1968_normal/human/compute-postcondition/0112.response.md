Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of positive integers, `be` is 0, `en` is `n`, `ans` is `n`, `out` contains the updated values from `n` to `n` joined as a string separated by spaces, `md` is half of `n`, updated `su` based on the next index `i`, `i` is `md + 3` for the loop to execute one more time, `su` is -1. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
