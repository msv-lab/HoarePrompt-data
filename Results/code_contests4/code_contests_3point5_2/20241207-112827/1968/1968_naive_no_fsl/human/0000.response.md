Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input for the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it sorts the list of tokens in ascending order to determine the players with the least number of tokens.
3. It then uses binary search to find the number of players who have a non-zero probability of winning the championship. The binary search logic correctly identifies the players who have a chance of winning based on the sum of tokens they possess.
4. The program then outputs the count of players with a non-zero probability followed by the indices of those players in increasing order.
5. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all possible scenarios, ensuring that the correct players are identified.
