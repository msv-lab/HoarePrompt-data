Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to check if Limak's journey satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description. It iterates through each part of the journey, updates Limak's height based on the direction, and checks if the height is within the valid range. It also ensures that the journey ends on the North Pole. The program correctly handles all the conditions mentioned in the problem description for every potential case. Thus, the code is correct.
