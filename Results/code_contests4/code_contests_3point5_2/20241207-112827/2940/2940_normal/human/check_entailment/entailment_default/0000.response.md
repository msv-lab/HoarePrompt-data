Correctness: **True**

After analyzing the code and the problem description, we can see that the code accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description:
- It correctly updates the height based on the movements in the North or South directions.
- It ensures that Limak can only move from the North Pole to the South Pole if he is at the North Pole, and vice versa.
- It checks if the final height is equal to the predefined value of HEIGHT (20000) and prints "YES" if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise it prints "NO".

Additionally, the output hints agree with the code by explaining the purpose of the code correctly. The code handles all the potential cases as described in the problem, making it correct.
