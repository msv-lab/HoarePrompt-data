Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for `n`, `ti`, and `diri` correctly. It then iterates through each part of Limak's journey, updating his `height` based on the direction he moves. The program correctly checks if Limak's height goes below 0 or exceeds the predefined `HEIGHT` value of 20000, setting `sat` to False if this occurs. Finally, the program checks if Limak ends his journey at the North Pole (`height == HEIGHT`) and prints "YES" if all conditions are satisfied.

The program follows the problem description accurately by enforcing the conditions that Limak can only move to the South if he is on the North Pole and can only move to the North if he is on the South Pole. It also ensures that Limak's journey ends on the North Pole. This makes the program correct for all possible cases.
