Example Answer:
The constant `HEIGHT` is assigned the value `20000`. Since `HEIGHT` is a constant, it does not affect the initial state variables `n`, `ti`, and `diri`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000**
