Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", `HEIGHT` is 20000, `f` is assigned to sys.stdin, `sat` is False, `dst` and `direction` are assigned values. If `direction` is 'North', `height` is increased by the integer value of `dst`. If `direction` is 'South', `height` is decreased by the integer value of `dst'. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Invalid direction'. After the if else block executes, the height of the program will remain in the valid range between 0 and HEIGHT (20000).***
