Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", `HEIGHT` is 20000, `f` is assigned to sys.stdin, `height` is within the range of 0 to 20000, `sat` is True if the height remains within the valid range after all iterations of the loop. If at any point the height goes below 0 or exceeds HEIGHT, `sat` is False**
