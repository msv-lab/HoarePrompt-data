Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", `HEIGHT` is 20000, `f` is assigned to sys.stdin, `sat` is False, `dst` and `direction` are assigned values. If `direction` is 'South', `HEIGHT` is decreased by the integer value of `dst`. If `direction` is 'North', `HEIGHT` is increased by the integer value of `dst'. If `direction` is not in {'South', 'North'}, the program state remains unchanged. After the execution of the if else block, the program will ensure that the `HEIGHT` remains within the range of 0 to 20000.***
