Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", `HEIGHT` is 20000, `f` is assigned to sys.stdin, `height` is either increased by the integer value of `dst` if `direction` is 'North', or remains at 20000 if `direction` is not 'North'. `sat` is True, for the loop to execute the first time, `dst` is assigned the first value from the input line, `direction` is assigned the second value from the input line. Additionally, if `direction` is not in {'South', 'North'}, then the program state remains unchanged. The direction is not 'South' and not 'North'.***
