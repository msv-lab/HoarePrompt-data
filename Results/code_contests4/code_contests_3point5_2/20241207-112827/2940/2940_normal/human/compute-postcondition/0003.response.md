Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer read from standard input using `f.readline()`. The previous values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, height is 20000.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, height is 20000**
