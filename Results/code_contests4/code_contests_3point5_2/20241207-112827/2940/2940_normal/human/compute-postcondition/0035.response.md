According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", `HEIGHT` is 20000, `f` is assigned to sys.stdin, `sat` is False, `dst` and `direction` are assigned values**.
