Example Answer:
The variable `sat` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, height is 20000, sat is True.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, Each ti is a positive integer, diri is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", HEIGHT is 20000, f is assigned to sys.stdin, height is 20000, sat is True**
