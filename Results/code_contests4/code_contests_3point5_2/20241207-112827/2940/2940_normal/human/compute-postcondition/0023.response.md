According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, each `ti` is a positive integer, `diri` is a string that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East", `HEIGHT` is 20000, `f` is assigned to sys.stdin, `height` is either increased by the integer value of `dst` if `direction` is 'North', or remains at 20000 if `direction` is not 'North', `sat` is False, `dst` and `direction` are not assigned values**
