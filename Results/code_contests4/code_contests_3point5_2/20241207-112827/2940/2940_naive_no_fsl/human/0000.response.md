Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if the description of Limak's journey satisfies the three conditions mentioned in the problem description. It keeps track of Limak's height as he moves in the specified directions and ensures that he ends on the North Pole. The program iterates through each part of the journey, updates Limak's height based on the direction, and checks if the height remains within the valid range. Finally, it checks if Limak ends on the North Pole and prints "YES" if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise "NO".

The program covers all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and correctly determines whether the journey description is valid. All the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, making it a correct solution for the given problem.
