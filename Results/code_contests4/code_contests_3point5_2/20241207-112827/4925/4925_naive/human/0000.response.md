Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the given graph. The program reads the input, constructs the graph, and then uses union-find data structure to find the minimum spanning tree. The algorithm is sound and complete, covering all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
