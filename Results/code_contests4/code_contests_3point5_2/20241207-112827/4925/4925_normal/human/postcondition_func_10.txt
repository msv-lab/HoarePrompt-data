The function func_9 accepts a list of tuples 'l' representing edges in a graph, as well as start and end vertices. It returns a range starting from the 'start' vertex to the end of the list 'l' plus the 'end' vertex. One potential issue is that the code does not handle cases where 'start' or 'end' are out of bounds compared to the length of the list 'l'. It also does not consider cases where 'start' is greater than 'end'.
