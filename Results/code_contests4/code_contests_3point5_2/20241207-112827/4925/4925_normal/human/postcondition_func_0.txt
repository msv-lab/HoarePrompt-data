The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates and prints the maximum number of edges in a graph with `n` nodes and `m` connected components based on the given constraints. It initializes values, forms sets, updates sets based on input, finds the node with the minimum connections, performs unions on sets, finds roots, and finally prints the result by counting the number of unique roots minus 1. The code lacks clarity on the functions `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_7`, `union`, and `find`, which are used but not defined within the provided code. Additionally, the purpose of the `print` statement at the end is unclear.
