The function func_3 accepts two parameters, x and y, where x is an integer between 1 and 10^5, and y is an integer between 0 and min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). The function then updates the values of x and y based on a loop until y becomes 0. Finally, it returns the updated integer value of x after the loop has finished executing. If the loop does not properly update x and y according to the annotations, the functionality should reflect the actual behavior of the code.
