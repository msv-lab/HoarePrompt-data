According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `roots` contains the result of `find(i)`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`roots` contains the result of `find(1)`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
