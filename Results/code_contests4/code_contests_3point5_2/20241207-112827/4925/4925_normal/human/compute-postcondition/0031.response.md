Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m satisfies the conditions, p contains elements from 0 to n-1, sg is the value returned by calling the function func_7 with arguments set and n, v is assigned the index with the minimum length of sets in sg, i is in sg[v], j is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time j is in the range of n. If j is not in sg[i], then the program continues with the same state as before the if statement.***
