Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of the expression `ceil(x / r)` to the empty string `"""`. Without knowing the values of `x` and `r`, we cannot calculate the result. Therefore, the Output State is: `"""` is assigned the value of `ceil(x / r)`.
Output State: **`"""` is assigned the value of `ceil(x / r)`**
