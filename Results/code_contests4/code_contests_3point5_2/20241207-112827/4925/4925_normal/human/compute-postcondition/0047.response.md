Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` satisfies the conditions, `p` contains elements from 0 to n-1, `sg` is the value returned by calling the function `func_7` with arguments `set` and `n`, `v` is assigned the index with the minimum length of sets in `sg`, and the necessary adjustments for the next iteration have been made based on the value of `i`. If `i` is not in the set at index `v` in `sg`, the `union` operation has been performed between the sets at index `i` and `v`. Otherwise, all elements in `sg` are unioned with `i`.***
