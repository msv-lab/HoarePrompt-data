Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(len(roots) - 1)` prints the length of the list `roots` minus 1. The initial state mentions that `roots` contains the result of `find(i)` for each `i` in the range of `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the length of `roots` is equal to `n`, and the output of the code will be `n - 1`.
Output State: **The result of n - 1 is printed.**
