Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` satisfies the conditions, `p` contains elements from 0 to n-1, `sg` is updated based on the value of `i`, `v` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. If `j` is not in sg[i], then the program continues with the next iteration.***
