Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `p`, `sg`, and `v` have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. If `i` is not in the set at index `v` in `sg`, then all variables remain the same except the set at index `v` in `sg` is updated by adding the set at index `i` to it. If `i` is in the set at index `v` in `sg`, then all elements in `sg[i]` are unioned with `i`.**
