Example Answer:
`find(i)` is called and the result is added to the set `roots`. The initial state does not provide information about the value returned by `find(i)` or the existing elements in the set `roots`, so the output state is: `roots` contains the result of `find(i)`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`roots` contains the result of `find(i)`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
