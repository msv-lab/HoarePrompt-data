Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m satisfies the conditions, p contains elements from 0 to n-1, sg is the value returned by calling the function func_7 with arguments set and n, v is assigned the index with the minimum length of sets in sg, i is in sg[v], for the loop to execute j is in the range of n, if j is not in sg[i], then union(i, j) is executed.***
