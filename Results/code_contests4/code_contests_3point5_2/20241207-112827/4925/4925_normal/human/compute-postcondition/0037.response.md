Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` satisfies the conditions, `p` contains elements from 0 to n-1, `sg` is the value returned by calling the function `func_7` with arguments `set` and `n`, `v` is assigned the index with the minimum length of sets in `sg`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `j` is not in the set `sg[i]`***
