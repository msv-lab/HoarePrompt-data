Example Answer:
The `find` function is called with the argument `i` which is currently 1. The result of the `find` function is added to the `roots` set. Since `i` is 1, the output of `find(1)` is already in the `roots` set from the initial state. Therefore, after the execution, the `roots` set remains the same with the result of `find(1)` included twice.
Output State: **`roots` contains the result of `find(1)` twice, `i` is 1**
