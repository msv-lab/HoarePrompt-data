According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `roots` being an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`roots` is an empty set, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
