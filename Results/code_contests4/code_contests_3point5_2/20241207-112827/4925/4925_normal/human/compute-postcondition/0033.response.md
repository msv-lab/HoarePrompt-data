Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` satisfies the conditions, `p` contains elements from 0 to n-1, `sg` is the value returned by calling the function `func_7` with arguments `set` and `n`, `v` is assigned the index with the minimum length of sets in `sg`. If `i` is not in `sg[v]`, then all variables remain the same except the set at index `v` in `sg` is updated by adding the set at index `i` to it. If `i` is in `sg[v]`, then `n` is greater than 0, `m` satisfies the conditions, `p` contains elements from 0 to n-1, `sg` is the value returned by calling the function `func_7` with arguments `set` and `n`, `v` is assigned the index with the minimum length of sets in `sg`, and all elements in `sg[i]` are unioned with `i`.***
