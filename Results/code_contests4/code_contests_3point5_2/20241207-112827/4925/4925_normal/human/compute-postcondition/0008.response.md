The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. The parameter `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^5, and the parameter `y` is also an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). After the loop has finished executing, the function returns the updated integer value of `x`. The value of `y` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, where x is an integer between 1 and 10^5 and y is an integer between 0 and min((x(x-1))/(2),10^5). The function returns the updated integer value of x after the loop has finished executing, with y being 0 indicating the end of the loop.**
