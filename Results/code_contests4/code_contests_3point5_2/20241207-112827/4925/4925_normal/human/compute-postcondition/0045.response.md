Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` satisfies the conditions, `p` contains elements from 0 to n-1, `sg` is the value returned by calling the function `func_7` with arguments `set` and `n`, `v` is assigned the index with the minimum length of sets in `sg`, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` and `j` are now unioned, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is not in `sg[i]`, then the program state remains unchanged.***
