The function `union` accepts two parameters `u` and `v`, both of which are integers. The constraints for `u` and `v` are such that they are equal, and the function returns the value of either `u` or `v` if they are equal. Therefore, the functionality of the function `union` is to accept two integer parameters `u` and `v`, and return the value of either `u` or `v` if they are equal.
