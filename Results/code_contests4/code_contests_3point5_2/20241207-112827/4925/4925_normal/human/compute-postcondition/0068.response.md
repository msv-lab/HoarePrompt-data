According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `roots` contains the result of `find(1)` twice, `i` is 1. Since i is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, i should be 2.
State: **`roots` contains the result of `find(1)` twice, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
