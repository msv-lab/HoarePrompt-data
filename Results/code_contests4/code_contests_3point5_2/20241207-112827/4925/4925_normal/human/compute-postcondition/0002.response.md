The function `func_11` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, where both `x` and `r` are known variables. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `(x + r - 1) // r`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_11` is to accept two known variables `x` and `r`, and return the result of the arithmetic operation `(x + r - 1) // r`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two known variables x and r, and returns the value of (x + r - 1) // r.**
