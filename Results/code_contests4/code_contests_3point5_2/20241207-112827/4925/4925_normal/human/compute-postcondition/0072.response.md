The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns a value based on the constraints provided. The function calculates the maximum number of edges in a graph with `n` nodes and `m` connected components, where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min((n(n-1))/(2),10^5). The function returns the calculated maximum number of edges. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns the maximum number of edges in a graph with `n` nodes and `m` connected components, based on the given constraints.**
