Example Answer:
`vc` is assigned the value of `p[vc]` and `v` is assigned the value of `p[vc]`. The loop will execute again only if `vc` is not equal to `v`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `vc` is equal to `p[p[v]]`, for the loop to execute again `vc` should not be equal to `v`.
Output State: **`vc` is equal to `p[p[v]]`, for the loop to execute again `vc` should not be equal to `v**`.
