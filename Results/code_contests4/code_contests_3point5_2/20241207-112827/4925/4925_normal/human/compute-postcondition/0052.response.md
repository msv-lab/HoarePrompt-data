Example Answer:
The function `union(i, j)` is called, but the specific implementation and its effects on the variables are not provided. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` satisfies the conditions, `p` contains elements from 0 to n-1, `sg` is updated based on the value of `i`, `v` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `j` is not in sg[i]**
