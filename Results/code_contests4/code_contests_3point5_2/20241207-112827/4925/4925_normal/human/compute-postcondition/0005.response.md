Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are swapped, and `x` is assigned the value of the modulus operation of the previous values of `x` and `y`. The loop will execute again only if `y` is non-zero. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` have been updated as per the given conditions.
Output State: **`x` and `y` have been updated as per the given conditions**
