According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `y` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` and `y` are updated integers satisfying the given conditions. For the loop to execute again, the only state that needs to be adjusted is for `y` to remain non-zero.
State: **`x` and `y` are updated integers satisfying the given conditions, for the loop to execute again `y` needs to be non-zero**.
