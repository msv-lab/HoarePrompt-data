Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the algorithm to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph as described in the problem description. The program follows the steps of building the graph, finding the minimum spanning tree, and calculating the weight of the tree based on the given input.

The program uses functions to handle operations like finding the root of a vertex, union of two vertices, and other necessary calculations required for finding the minimum spanning tree.

Overall, the program structure and functions align with the problem description requirements, making it a correct implementation.
