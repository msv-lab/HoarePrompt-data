Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code lacks clarity on the functions `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_7`, `union`, and `find`, which are used but not defined within the provided code. This makes it difficult to verify the correctness of the program.
- The purpose of the `print` statement at the end of the code is unclear, and it is not explicitly stated in the annotations.
- The code does not handle cases where the roots of `u` and `v` in the `union` function are not equal, which might be a missing edge case.
- Given the lack of clarity in the provided code and missing function definitions, it is challenging to determine if the code adheres to the problem description for every potential case.
