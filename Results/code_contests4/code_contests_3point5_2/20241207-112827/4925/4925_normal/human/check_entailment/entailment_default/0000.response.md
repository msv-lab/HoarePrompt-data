Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code lacks clarity on the functions `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_7`, `union`, and `find`, which are used but not defined within the provided code. This makes it difficult to understand how the code works.
- The function `func_1` seems to be trying to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the given graph. However, there are potential cases where the code might not follow the problem description:
  1. The code might not correctly handle cases where there are multiple minimum spanning trees with different weights.
  2. The code might not consider all possible edge cases related to the graph structure and weights.
  
Based on the lack of clarity and potential issues mentioned above, the correctness of the code cannot be guaranteed.
