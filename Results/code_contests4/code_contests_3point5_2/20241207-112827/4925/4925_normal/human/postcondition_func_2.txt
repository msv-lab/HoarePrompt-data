The function `union` takes two integer parameters `u` and `v`, finds their respective roots using the `find` function, and performs union operation on them. If the roots of `u` and `v` are equal, the function returns without performing any further action. If the rank of the root of `u` is less than the rank of the root of `v`, the function swaps `u` and `v`. Then, it updates the parent array `p` by setting the parent of `u` to `v`. If the ranks of the roots `u` and `v` are equal, the rank of `u` is incremented by 1. The function does not handle the case where the roots of `u` and `v` are not equal, which might be a missing edge case.
