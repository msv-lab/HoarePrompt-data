Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

1. The program correctly reads the input as described in the problem statement.
2. It correctly constructs the minimum spanning tree by iterating through the vertices and edges.
3. The program uses union-find algorithm to determine the connected components and find the minimum spanning tree.
4. The output is the weight of the minimum spanning tree, which is the correct answer based on the problem description.
5. The program seems to handle all possible cases and follows the requirements specified in the problem description.
