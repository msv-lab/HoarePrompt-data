Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program implements a solution to the given problem description. It follows the logic described in the problem statement by recursively calculating the optimal strategy for selecting the elements in the array based on the positions of friends in the line. The program considers different scenarios of persuading friends to take either the first or the last element to maximize the minimum element that the person at the m-th position can get.

The program handles multiple test cases, reads input correctly, and produces the expected output. It also uses appropriate functions for input/output operations and recursive calculations. 

As the code is implementing the described logic for the problem statement and considering all possible scenarios to determine the maximum integer x, it is correct.
