You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your n - 1 friends have found an array of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You have decided to share it in the following way: All n of you stand in a line in a particular order. Each minute, the person at the front of the line chooses either the first or the last element of the array, removes it, and keeps it for himself. He then gets out of line, and the next person in line continues the process.

You are standing in the m-th position in the line. Before the process starts, you may choose up to k different people in the line, and persuade them to always take either the first or the last element in the array on their turn (for each person his own choice, not necessarily equal for all people), no matter what the elements themselves are. Once the process starts, you cannot persuade any more people, and you cannot change the choices for the people you already persuaded.

Suppose that you're doing your choices optimally. What is the greatest integer x such that, no matter what are the choices of the friends you didn't choose to control, the element you will take from the array will be greater than or equal to x?

Please note that the friends you don't control may do their choice arbitrarily, and they will not necessarily take the biggest element available.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of elements in the array, your position in line and the number of people whose choices you can fix.

The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3500.

Output

For each test case, print the largest integer x such that you can guarantee to obtain at least x.

Note

In the first test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the last element and the second person to take the first element.

  * the first person will take the last element (5) because he or she was forced by you to take the last element. After this turn the remaining array will be [2, 9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * the second person will take the first element (2) because he or she was forced by you to take the first element. After this turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3, 8]; 
  * if the third person will choose to take the first element (9), at your turn the remaining array will be [2, 3, 8] and you will take 8 (the last element); 
  * if the third person will choose to take the last element (8), at your turn the remaining array will be [9, 2, 3] and you will take 9 (the first element). 



Thus, this strategy guarantees to end up with at least 8. We can prove that there is no strategy that guarantees to end up with at least 9. Hence, the answer is 8.

In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to force the first person to take the first element. Then, in the worst case, both the second and the third person will take the first element: you will end up with 4.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The annotations do not specify any specific functionality beyond this.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prints the value of the parameter `s` to the standard output. However, the postconditions do not provide information about what the function should return or any additional functionality based on the input parameter `s`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. a_i are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns an integer after reading a line of input and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input read line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, splits it, and converts the elements to integers, returning a map object containing these integers. The function essentially processes input data by converting it into a map object of integers. The annotations mention that the input consists of integers, but the function itself does not enforce this constraint or handle cases where the input is not as expected.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 3500 and 0 <= k <= n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.**
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns the input read from the console after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads input from the console and returns the input after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The input consists of test cases where `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 3500 and 0 <= `k` <= `n` - 1. The array elements `a_i` are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9. The function does not accept any parameters.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input obtained from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for an input and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `debug` is true (evaluates to true), then the program executes the debugging statements. Otherwise, no action is taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. If the variable `debug` evaluates to true, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it does nothing. The functionality of the function is to serve as a debugging mechanism when `debug` is true, providing insight into the arguments passed to the function.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **

        if lcut <= k and r - pl >= seglen:
            ans = max(ans, func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))
        
        if rcut <= k and pr - l >= seglen:
            ans = max(ans, func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen))

        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will either continue executing or break based on the conditions within the loop. The values of the variables will be updated and checked against certain conditions, resulting in `ans` being the maximum value calculated by the function calls. The loop will continue until the conditions are no longer met, at which point it will break out.
    ans = 10000000000.0

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the maximum values in the segments defined by `seglen` within `A`. `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum values in the segments defined by 'seglen' within matrix A. 'l', 'r', and 'i' remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. It iterates through a for loop based on conditions and updates the variable `ans`. It then calculates the minimum value between the maximum values in segments defined by `seglen` within matrix A and returns this minimum value. The function does not return the maximum value between 'ans' and the results of different function calls as mentioned in the annotations. The provided annotations do not accurately reflect what the function does.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
