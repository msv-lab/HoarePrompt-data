#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter `s` and writes the string representation of `s` to the standard output. The annotations do not specify any specific functionality beyond this.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_2(s):
    sys.stdout.write(str(s))
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prints the value of the parameter `s` to the standard output. However, the postconditions do not provide information about what the function should return or any additional functionality based on the input parameter `s`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. a_i are positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_3():
    return int(readln().strip())
    #The program returns an integer after reading a line of input and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 3500, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
def func_4():
    return map(int, readln().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers after splitting the input read line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, splits it, and converts the elements to integers, returning a map object containing these integers. The function essentially processes input data by converting it into a map object of integers. The annotations mention that the input consists of integers, but the function itself does not enforce this constraint or handle cases where the input is not as expected.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 3500 and 0 <= k <= n - 1. The array elements a_i are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.**
def func_5():
    return readln().strip()
    #The program returns the input read from the console after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads input from the console and returns the input after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The input consists of test cases where `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 3500 and 0 <= `k` <= `n` - 1. The array elements `a_i` are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9. The function does not accept any parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_6():
    return readln().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input obtained from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for an input and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_7():
    if debug :
        print(' '.join(map(str, args)))
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `debug` is true (evaluates to true), then the program executes the debugging statements. Otherwise, no action is taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. If the variable `debug` evaluates to true, it prints the arguments passed to the function. Otherwise, it does nothing. The functionality of the function is to serve as a debugging mechanism when `debug` is true, providing insight into the arguments passed to the function.

    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum values in the segments defined by 'seglen' within matrix A. 'l', 'r', and 'i' remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, `A`, `prilist`, `pri_idx`, and `seglen`. It iterates through a for loop based on conditions and updates the variable `ans`. It then calculates the minimum value between the maximum values in segments defined by `seglen` within matrix A and returns this minimum value. The function does not return the maximum value between 'ans' and the results of different function calls as mentioned in the annotations. The provided annotations do not accurately reflect what the function does.
