Example Answer:
The values of `v`, `pl`, and `pr` are assigned from the tuple at index `pi` in the list `prilist`. The value of `pi` is equal to `pri_idx` initially. Therefore, `v`, `pl`, and `pr` are assigned the values from the tuple at index `pri_idx` in the list `prilist`. 
Output State: **`pri_idx` is less than `len(prilist) - 1`, `pi` is equal to `pri_idx`, `v`, `pl`, `pr` are assigned values from the tuple at index `pri_idx` in `prilist`**
