Postcondition: ***`rcut` is a positive value, `pi` is incremented by 1, `v`, `pl`, and `pr` are assigned values from the `pi`th index of the list `prilist`, `lcut` is calculated based on the updated values of `pi`, `pl`, `l`, and the list `prilist`, `ans` is updated based on the maximum value between the current `ans` and the return value of `func_8`. If `rcut` is less than or equal to `k` and the difference between `pr` and `l` is greater than or equal to `seglen`, then the program returns the updated value of 'ans' based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet. Otherwise, `rcut` is a positive value, `pi` is incremented by 1, `v`, `pl`, and `pr` are assigned values from the `pi`th index of the list `prilist`, `lcut` is calculated based on the updated values of `pi`, `pl`, `l`, and the list `prilist`, `ans` is updated based on the maximum value between the current `ans` and the return value of `func_8`.***
