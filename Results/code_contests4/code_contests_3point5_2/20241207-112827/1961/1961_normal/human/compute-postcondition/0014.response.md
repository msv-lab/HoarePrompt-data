Postcondition: ***`pri_idx` is less than `len(prilist) - 1`, `pi` is equal to `pri_idx`, `v`, `pl`, `pr` are assigned values from the tuple at index `pri_idx` in `prilist`, `lcut` depends on the values of `pl` and `l`, `rcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `r - pr + 1`, `ans` is the maximum between the current value of `ans` and the result of the function call `func_8(pl + 1, r, k - lcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`, `lcut` is less than or equal to `k`, `r - pl` is greater than or equal to `seglen`, `rcut` is less than or equal to `k`, `pr - l` is greater than or equal to `seglen`. After the execution of the if block, the overall state of the program is updated such that `ans` is updated to be the maximum between the current value of `ans` and the result of the function call `func_8(l, pr - 1, k - rcut, A, prilist, pi + 1, seglen)`. Additionally, the condition `ans` is true.***
