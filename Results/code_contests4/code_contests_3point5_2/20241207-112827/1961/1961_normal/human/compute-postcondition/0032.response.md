According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pi` and the length of the `prilist`. If `pi` is less than `len(prilist) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `rcut` is assigned a positive value. For the loop to execute one more time, `pi` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`rcut` is assigned a positive value, for the loop to execute one more time `pi` should be incremented by 1**
