According to the code, the loop can execute if `pri_idx` is less than the length of `prilist` minus 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states so that `pri_idx` is less than the length of `prilist` minus 1. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`pri_idx` is less than `len(prilist) - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `pi` is equal to `pri_idx`**
