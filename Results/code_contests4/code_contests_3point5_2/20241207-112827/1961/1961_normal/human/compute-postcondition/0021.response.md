Example Answer:
`rcut` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of `r - pr + 1`. Based on the initial state where `r` is greater than `pr`, the result of `r - pr + 1` will be a positive value. Therefore, `rcut` will be assigned this positive value. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`rcut` is assigned a positive value**
