The function `func_5` reads input from the console and returns the input after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The input consists of test cases where `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 3500 and 0 <= `k` <= `n` - 1. The array elements `a_i` are positive integers less than or equal to 10^9. The function does not accept any parameters.
