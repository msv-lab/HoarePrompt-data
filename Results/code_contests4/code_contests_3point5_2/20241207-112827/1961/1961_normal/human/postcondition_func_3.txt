The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input, splits it, and converts the elements to integers, returning a map object containing these integers. The function essentially processes input data by converting it into a map object of integers. The annotations mention that the input consists of integers, but the function itself does not enforce this constraint or handle cases where the input is not as expected.
