Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('3')` simply prints the string '3' to the console. The variables `id`, `name of the document`, and `text of the document` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: id is an integer such that 0 <= id <= 10^6, the name of the document is a string, and the text of the document is a string with a size not exceeding 10 kilobytes.
Output State: **id is an integer such that 0 <= id <= 10^6, the name of the document is a string, and the text of the document is a string with a size not exceeding 10 kilobytes**
