Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It simply prints the number 3. The function operates under the constraints that `id` is an integer between 0 and 10^6, the document name is a string, and the document text is a string with a size not exceeding 10 kilobytes. The actual functionality beyond printing '3' is not explicitly defined in the annotations. **
