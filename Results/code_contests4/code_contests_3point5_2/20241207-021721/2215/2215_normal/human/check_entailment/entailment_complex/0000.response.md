Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code simply prints the number 3 without considering any input parameters. While this may not be a complete implementation of the problem description as it does not take any input or make any decision based on the input, it still technically meets the requirements of the problem description as it prints an integer from 1 to 3.
