Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the distance between the centers of circles A and B and then compares it with the sum and difference of their radii to determine the relationship between the circles. The conditions in the code handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The logic for each case (2, -2, 1, 0) is implemented correctly. The code also iterates over multiple datasets as specified in the input format. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
