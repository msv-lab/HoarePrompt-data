Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The program is using `map(int, raw_input().split())` to convert the input values to integers, but the input values are specified as real numbers in the problem description. This will cause the program to incorrectly convert the real numbers to integers, leading to incorrect calculations and output. 

Additionally, the calculation of distances and comparisons in the program are done using squared values, which may lead to incorrect results due to the omission of square roots in comparison calculations.
