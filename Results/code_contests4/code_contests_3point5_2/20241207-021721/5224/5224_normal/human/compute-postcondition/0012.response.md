Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, $xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb, d$ are assigned values based on the input split. The distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ is less than or equal to $(ra + rb)$. Additionally, after entering the if statement, $ra$ is greater than $rb$. If $(ra - rb) ** 2 > d$, the program prints 2. Otherwise, the program prints 1.***
