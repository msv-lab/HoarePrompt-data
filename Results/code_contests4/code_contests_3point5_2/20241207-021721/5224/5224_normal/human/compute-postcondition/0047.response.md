Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input datasets consisting of real numbers $x_a$, $y_a$, $r_a$, $x_b$, $y_b$, and $r_b. It then calculates the distance between two points (xa, ya) and (xb, yb) and compares it with the sum and difference of their respective radii to determine different outcomes (0, 1, 2, -2) based on specific conditions. The function repeats this process for each dataset provided.**
