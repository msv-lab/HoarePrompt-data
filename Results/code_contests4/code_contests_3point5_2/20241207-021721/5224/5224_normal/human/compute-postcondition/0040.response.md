Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints -2 and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: $N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop executes based on the condition $d > (ra + rb)$.
