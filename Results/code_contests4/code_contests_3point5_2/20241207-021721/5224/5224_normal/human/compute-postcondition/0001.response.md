According to the code, the loop can execute as long as $n$ is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, $N$ is a non-negative integer which doesn't ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to $n$ is greater than 0. 
State: **$N$ is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute $n$ is greater than 0**
