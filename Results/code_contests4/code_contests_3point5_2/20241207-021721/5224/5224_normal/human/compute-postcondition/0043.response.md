Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop executes based on the condition $d > (ra + rb)$. If $(ra - rb) > 0$, the function executes the if part, otherwise it executes the else part. In the if part, the function returns the result of the expression `(ra - rb)`. In the else part, the function returns the result of the expression `(rb - ra)`.***
