Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb, d` are assigned values based on the input split. The distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ is less than or equal to $(ra + rb)$. After entering the if statement, $ra > rb$ and the square of the difference between $ra$ and $rb$ is greater than `d`. The program prints 2.**
