Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, $xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb$ are assigned values based on the input split, $d$ is calculated as the square of the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$. The distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ squared is greater than the square of the sum of $ra$ and $rb$***
