Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, $xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb$ are assigned values based on the input split, $d$ is calculated as the square of the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$, and the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ is less than or equal to $(ra + rb)$. Additionally, after entering the if statement, $ra$ is greater than $rb$. The condition $((ra - rb) ** 2 > d)$ is false***
