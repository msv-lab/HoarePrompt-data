Example Answer: 
The value of `d` is calculated using the formula provided. The previous values of `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are unknown, so the exact value of `d` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: $N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop executes based on the condition $d > (ra + rb)$.
