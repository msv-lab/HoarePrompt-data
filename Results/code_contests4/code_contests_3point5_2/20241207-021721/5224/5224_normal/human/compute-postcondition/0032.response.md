Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values based on the input split, $i$ is incremented by 1, `d` is calculated based on the formula. If $d > (ra + rb) ** 2$, then the program prints 0. Otherwise, if $ra > rb$, the program updates the values accordingly. If $(ra - rb)$. If $rb > ra$, the program updates the values accordingly. If $(rb - ra)$.***
