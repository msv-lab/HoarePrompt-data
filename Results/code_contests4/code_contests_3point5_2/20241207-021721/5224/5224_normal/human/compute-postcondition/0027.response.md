Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values based on the input split, $i$ is incremented by 1, `d` is calculated based on the formula. If $(ra - rb) ** 2 > d$, the program prints 2. Otherwise, the program prints 1.***
