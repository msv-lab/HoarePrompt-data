The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it retrieves datasets consisting of real numbers $x_a$, $y_a$, $r_a$, $x_b$, $y_b$, and $r_b$. The function then processes these datasets to perform certain operations or tasks based on the given constraints and relationships. The output of the function can vary depending on the specific requirements of the task being performed.
