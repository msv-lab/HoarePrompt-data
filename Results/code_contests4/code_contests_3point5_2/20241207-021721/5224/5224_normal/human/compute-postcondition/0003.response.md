Example Answer:
The variable `d` is assigned the value of the square of the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ calculated using the distance formula. The values of $xa, ya, xb, yb$ are already assigned, so we can directly calculate the distance. Therefore, the Output State is: $N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, $xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb$ are assigned values based on the input split, and `d` is calculated as the square of the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$.
