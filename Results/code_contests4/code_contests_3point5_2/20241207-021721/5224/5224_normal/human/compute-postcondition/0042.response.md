Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop executes based on the condition $d > (ra + rb)$. If `(rb - ra) ** 2 > d`, the program executes as described. Otherwise, the program executes with the same initial conditions but additionally prints out 1.***
