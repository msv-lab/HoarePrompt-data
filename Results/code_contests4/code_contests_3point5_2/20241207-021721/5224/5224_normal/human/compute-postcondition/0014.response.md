Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, $xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb$ are assigned values based on the input split, and `d` is calculated as the square of the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$. The distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ is less than or equal to $(ra + rb)$. Additionally, $ra$ is less than or equal to $rb$. Moreover, $(rb - ra) ^ 2 > d$***
