Example Answer:
The values of `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, and `rb` are assigned based on the input split using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of these variables will be updated accordingly based on the input values. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: $N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values based on the input split, $i$ is incremented by 1.
Output State: **$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, `xa`, `ya`, `ra`, `xb`, `yb`, `rb` are assigned values based on the input split, $i$ is incremented by 1**
