Postcondition: ***$N$ is a non-negative integer, $n$ is greater than 0, $xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb, d$ are assigned values based on the input split. If the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ squared is greater than the square of the sum of $ra$ and $rb$, the program prints 0. Otherwise, if the distance between points $(xa, ya)$ and $(xb, yb)$ is less than or equal to $(ra + rb)$, the program updates the state based on the conditions specified. If $(ra - rb) < ((rb - ra) ^ 2)$, the program updates the state accordingly. If $(ra - rb) \geq ((rb - ra) ^ 2)$, the program executes the else part and updates the state based on the conditions specified.***
