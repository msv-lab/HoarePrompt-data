Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input datasets consisting of the coordinates and radii of two circles, calculates the distance between their centers, and compares it with the sum and difference of their radii to determine the correct output (2, -2, 1, or 0) based on the specified conditions. The program iterates over each dataset and prints the correct output for each case. Thus, the program always does what the problem description asks for and is correct.
