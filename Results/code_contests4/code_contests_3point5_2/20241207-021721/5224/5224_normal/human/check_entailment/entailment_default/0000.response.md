Correctness: **False**

The given code has an issue in the line where it reads the input values. It uses `int` instead of `float` for the coordinates and radii. This will cause the program to round down the input values to integers, potentially leading to incorrect results in calculating the distances and radii comparisons. This will result in the program not following the problem description for all potential cases. 

To correct this issue, the code should use `float` instead of `int`, like this:
```
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    (xa, ya, ra, xb, yb, rb) = map(float, input().split())
    d = (xa - xb) ** 2 + (ya - yb) ** 2
    if d > (ra + rb) ** 2:
        print(0)
    elif ra > rb:
        if (ra - rb) ** 2 > d:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(1)
    elif (rb - ra) ** 2 > d:
        print(-2)
    else:
        print(1)
```

By correctly parsing the input values as floats, the code will now accurately calculate the distances and radii comparisons, ensuring that it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
