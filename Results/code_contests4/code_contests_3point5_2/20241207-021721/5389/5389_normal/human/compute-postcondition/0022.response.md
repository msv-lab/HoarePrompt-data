Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `n`, `m` are assigned integer values, `bus` is a list of integers, `trol` is a list of integers, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` contains the sum of all elements in `bus` after applying the min function to each element, `trolsum` is the sum of the minimum values between `x * c1` and `c2` for all elements in `trol`, `res` is the sum of the minimum values between `bussum` and `c3` added to the minimum values between `trolsum` and `c3`, and then `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and `c4`.**
