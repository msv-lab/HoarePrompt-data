Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` is a list containing integers parsed from user input using `raw_input().split()`, `trol` is a list of integers created by converting the elements of `bus` to integers, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is updated based on the calculation `bussum += min(x * c1, c2)`, `trolsum` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `bus` contains at least one element, `x` is set to the first element in `bus`**
