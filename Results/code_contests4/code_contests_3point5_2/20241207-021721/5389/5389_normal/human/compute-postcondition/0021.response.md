Example Answer:
The variables `res` is assigned the minimum value between `bussum` and `c3`, added to the minimum value between `trolsum` and `c3`. The values of `bussum` and `trolsum` are calculated based on the existing values in `bus` and `trol` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` is a list containing integers parsed from user input using `raw_input().split()`, `trol` is a list of integers created from `bus`, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` contains the sum of all elements in `bus` after applying the min function to each element, `trolsum` is the sum of the minimum values between `x * c1` and `c2` for all elements in `trol`, and `res` is the sum of the minimum values between `bussum` and `c3` added to the minimum values between `trolsum` and `c3`.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` is a list containing integers parsed from user input using `raw_input().split()`, `trol` is a list of integers created from `bus`, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` contains the sum of all elements in `bus` after applying the min function to each element, `trolsum` is the sum of the minimum values between `x * c1` and `c2` for all elements in `trol`, `res` is the sum of the minimum values between `bussum` and `c3` added to the minimum values between `trolsum` and `c3`**
