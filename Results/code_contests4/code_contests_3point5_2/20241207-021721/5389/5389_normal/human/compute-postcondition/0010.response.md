Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` still contains elements, `trol` is a list of integers created from `bus`, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` is updated based on the calculation `bussum += min(x * c1, c2)`, `trolsum` is 0, for the loop to execute the next time `x` is set to the next element in `bus`, `bussum` is updated by adding the minimum of `x * c1` and `c2`.**
