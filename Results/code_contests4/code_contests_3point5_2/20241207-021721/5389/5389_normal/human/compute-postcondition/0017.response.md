Example Answer:
The value of `trolsum` is updated by adding the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2`. The value of `x` is the second element in the list `trol`, and for the loop to execute the second time, `trol` must have at least 2 elements. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` is a list containing integers parsed from user input using `raw_input().split()`, `trol` is a list of integers created from `bus`, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` contains the sum of all elements in `bus` after applying the min function to each element, `trolsum` is updated by adding the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2`.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` is a list containing integers parsed from user input using `raw_input().split()`, `trol` is a list of integers created from `bus`, `busc1` is an empty list, `bussum` contains the sum of all elements in `bus` after applying the min function to each element, `trolsum` is updated by adding the minimum value between `x * c1` and `c2`**
