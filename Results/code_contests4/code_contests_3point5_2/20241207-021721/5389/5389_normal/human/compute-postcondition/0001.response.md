Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned integer values based on user input by splitting the input and converting them to integers. The initial values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are not mentioned, so they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values**
