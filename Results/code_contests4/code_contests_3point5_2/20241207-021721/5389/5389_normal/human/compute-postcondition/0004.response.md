Example Answer:
`busc1` is assigned an empty list. The values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` is a list containing integers parsed from user input using `raw_input().split()`, `trol` is a list of integers created by converting the elements of `bus` to integers, and `busc1` is an empty list.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` have integer values based on user input, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values, `bus` is a list containing integers parsed from user input using `raw_input().split()`, `trol` is a list of integers created by converting the elements of `bus` to integers, and `busc1` is an empty list**
