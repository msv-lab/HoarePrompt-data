Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the costs of tickets, the number of buses and trolleys, and the number of rides Vasya is going to make on each bus and trolley. It then calculates the minimum sum of burles Vasya will have to spend on the tickets based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

The program correctly calculates the sum for buses and trolleys separately by considering the minimum cost between c1 and c2 for each ride. It then determines the minimum sum between the sum of bus rides and c3, and the sum of trolley rides and c3. Finally, it calculates the minimum between these two sums and c4 to get the overall minimum sum of burles Vasya needs to spend.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
