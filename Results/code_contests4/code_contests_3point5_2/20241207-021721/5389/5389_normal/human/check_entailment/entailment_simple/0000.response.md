Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum sum of burles that Vasya will have to spend on the tickets based on the given problem description. It calculates the cost for each bus and trolley separately by taking the minimum between the ride cost multiplied by the number of rides and the unlimited ride cost. Then, it calculates the minimum sum by considering the total cost for buses, trolleys, and the unlimited ride options. Finally, it prints the minimum sum as the output. This approach aligns with the problem description and provides the correct result for all possible cases.
