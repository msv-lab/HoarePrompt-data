Correctness: **False**

The given program does not seem to correctly solve the problem described. The logic in the `func_2` function is complex and hard to follow, making it difficult to determine if it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the use of binary search in `func_1` might not be necessary for this specific problem.

Without a clear understanding of the program logic and potential edge cases, it is difficult to determine if the program is correct. A more structured and understandable approach to the problem would be needed to ensure correctness.
