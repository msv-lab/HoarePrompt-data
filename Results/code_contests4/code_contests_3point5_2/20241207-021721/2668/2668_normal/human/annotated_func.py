    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `num`, `lis1`, `low`, and `high`. It iterates through the list `lis1` using binary search to find the value of `num`. If `num` is found, it returns True and the corresponding value from the list. If `num` is not found, it returns False and -1. The functionality does not cover all potential edge cases such as what happens if the list `lis1` is empty or if `low` is greater than `high`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input data from a file named 'input.txt' if it exists; otherwise, it reads from `sys.stdin`. It then processes the input data, performs some operations on it, and generates an output value. The output value is either the second element of a tuple based on certain conditions or 1 if those conditions are not met. Finally, it writes the output to a file named 'output.txt' if it exists, or to the standard output. This function does not accept any parameters.
