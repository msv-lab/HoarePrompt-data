Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input data from a file named 'input.txt' if it exists; otherwise, it reads from `sys.stdin`. It then processes the input data, performs some operations on it, and generates an output value. The output value is either the second element of a tuple based on certain conditions or 1 if those conditions are not met. Finally, it writes the output to a file named 'output.txt' if it exists, or to the standard output. This function does not accept any parameters.**
