Example Answer: 
`res` is assigned the value True. Since the first element of `back` evaluates to True, there is no change in the state of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with specified parameters, `res` is True.
Output State: **`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with specified parameters, `res` is True**
