According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `uniques`. If `uniques` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples with elements from `subs` list and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `y` is the length of `subs`, `subs` is a list with at least one element, and all tuples appended to `templis` satisfy the condition `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element and `z` is 0.
State: **`back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples with elements from `subs` list and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `y` is the length of `subs`, `subs` is a list with at least one element, and all tuples appended to `templis` satisfy the condition `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]`, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is 0**
