Output State: **`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, `counts` is a list containing a tuple, `i` is 0, counts.append((counts[len(counts) - 1][0] + 1, init[i])) is executed. Therefore, a new tuple is appended to `counts` where the first element is one more than the first element of the last tuple in `counts`, and the second element is the element at index `i` in `init`. The value of `i` is not updated in the code snippet.**
