Example Answer:
The list `init` is sorted in reverse order. The previous values of `init` are unknown, but after sorting in reverse, the list is rearranged in descending order. Therefore, the Output State is: If 'input.txt' exists in the current directory, then `input` is a file object in read mode. If 'input.txt' does not exist, then `input` is sys.stdin. `n` is an integer read from the input source. `init` is a list of integers obtained by applying the `int` function to each element in the list obtained by splitting the input line, sorted in reverse order.
