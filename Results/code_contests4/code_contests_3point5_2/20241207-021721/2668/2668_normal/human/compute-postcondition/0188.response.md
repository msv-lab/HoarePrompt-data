Example Answer:
The value of `res` is assigned to True. Since the value of `res` is already True, there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
