Example Answer:
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the result of calling `func_1`. The value of `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
