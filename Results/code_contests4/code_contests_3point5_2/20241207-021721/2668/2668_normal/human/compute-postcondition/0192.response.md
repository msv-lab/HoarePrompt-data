According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `uniques`. If the length of `uniques` is greater than the current value of `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `back[0]` is True, then the program continues with the current state. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `uniques` must be greater than the current value of `i`.
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, for the loop to execute again the length of `uniques` must be greater than the current value of `i`**
