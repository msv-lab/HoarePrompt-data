Example Answer:
The program calls the function `func_1` with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. The program then breaks out of the current loop. Since the initial state remains unchanged, the output state is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the current loop.**
