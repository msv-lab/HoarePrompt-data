Example Answer: 
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the result of calling `func_1` with specified parameters. The value of `res` is True. Therefore, after execution, `anss` contains the result of `func_1` and `res` remains True.
Output State: **`back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True**
