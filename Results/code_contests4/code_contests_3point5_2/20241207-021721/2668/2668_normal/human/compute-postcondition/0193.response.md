Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`. The value of `res` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. For the loop to execute again, the length of `uniques` must be greater than the current value of `i`. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, for the loop to execute again the length of `uniques` must be greater than the current value of `i`**
