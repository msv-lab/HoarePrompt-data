Postcondition: *`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, `counts` is a list containing a tuple. The value of `i` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration. The element at index `i` in `init` is equal to the element at index `i - 1`*
