Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is a file object in read mode or `sys.stdin`, `n` is an integer, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, counts is a list containing tuples, uniques is a list containing unique tuples, `audio` is a list of tuples, `subs` is a list of integers, `res` is False, `anss` is 0, `audio2` is a sorted version of the `audio` list, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` is not empty, `i` is 0, and `back` stores the result of `func_1`.
Output State: **`input` is a file object in read mode or `sys.stdin`, `n` is an integer, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, counts is a list containing tuples, uniques is a list containing unique tuples, `audio` is a list of tuples, `subs` is a list of integers, `res` is False, `anss` is 0, `audio2` is a sorted version of the `audio` list, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` is not empty, `i` is 0, `back` stores the result of `func_1`**
