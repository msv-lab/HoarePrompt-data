Example Answer:
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, which is the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`. The value of `res` is True. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True.
Output State: **`back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True**
