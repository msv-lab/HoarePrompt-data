Postcondition: ***`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, counts is a list containing tuples where each tuple represents the count of consecutive elements and the element itself, uniques is a list containing the first tuple from the counts list, the newly appended element if the loop executes one more time, and counts[i], i is the value that makes the loop or if statement exit, x is the first tuple in the counts list, and the appended element from counts[i] is added to uniques if counts[i][1] is not equal to counts[i + 1][1]. If i + 1 is equal to the length of counts, then the loop or if statement exits, and the program retains the described state with no changes.***
