Postcondition: ***`input` is a file object in read mode or `sys.stdin`, `n` is an integer, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, counts is a list containing tuples, uniques is a list containing unique tuples, `audio` is a list of tuples, `subs` is a list of integers, `res` is either True or False depending on the conditions met in the loop. After all iterations of the loop, `back` will contain the result of the last call to `func_1`, `res` will be True if at least one call to `func_1` returned True, `anss` will contain the result of the last successful call to `func_1`. If no call to `func_1` returned True, `res` will remain False. If `res` is True, `output` will be the second element of the tuple stored in `anss`. If `res` is False, `output` will be 1. The condition `os.path.exists('output.txt')` is True***
