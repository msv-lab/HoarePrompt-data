Postcondition: ***`back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains a tuple with elements from `subs` list and `y + 1`, `y` is 1, `subs` is a list with at least 1 element, the first element of audio[y] is still equal to the second element of uniques[i], and `templis` has been appended with a new tuple of (subs[y], y + 1) if audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1].***
