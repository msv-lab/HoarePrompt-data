Postcondition: ***`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, `counts` is a list containing tuples. If init[i] == init[i - 1], a new tuple is appended to `counts` at the end. If init[i] != init[i - 1], a new tuple (1, init[i]) is appended to `counts`. `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.***
