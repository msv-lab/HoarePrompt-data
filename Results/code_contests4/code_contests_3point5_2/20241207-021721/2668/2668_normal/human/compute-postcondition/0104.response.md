According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `subs`. If the length of `subs` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
1. `back` should be the result of `func_1`
2. `res` should be True
3. `templis` can remain as an empty list
4. `y` should be 0
5. `subs` should be a list with at least 1 element

State: **`back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `subs` is a list with at least 1 element**
