According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `uniques`. If `i` is less than the length of `uniques`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True and we broke out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since we are breaking out of the loop, no changes are needed to `i` or `uniques`. 
State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
