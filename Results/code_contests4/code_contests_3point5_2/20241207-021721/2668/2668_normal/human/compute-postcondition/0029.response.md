Postcondition: ***`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, `counts` is a list containing tuples. If init[i] == init[i - 1], the counts list contains an additional tuple appended and `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration if `i` equals 0. Otherwise, counts contains the appended tuple (1, init[i]) and `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration if `i` equals 0.***
