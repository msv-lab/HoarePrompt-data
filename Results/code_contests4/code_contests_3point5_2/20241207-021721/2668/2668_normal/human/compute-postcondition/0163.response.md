Example Answer: 
`anss` is assigned the value of `back`, where `back` is the return value of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`. Given that `back[0]` is True and `back` is assigned the same value as `anss`, the new value of `anss` would also be True. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is True, `anss` is True, `subs` has at least 1 element, `templis` contains tuples based on conditions, for the loop to execute another time `uniques` has at least 1 more element, `z` is 1, `back` is True.
Output State: **`res` is True, `anss` is True, `subs` has at least 1 element, `templis` contains tuples based on conditions, for the loop to execute another time `uniques` has at least 1 more element, `z` is 1, `back` is True**
