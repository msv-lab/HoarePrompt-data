Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, `len(templis) - 1`. The value of `z` is 0, `templis` contains tuples based on the conditions mentioned, and `uniques` has at least one element. Therefore, `back` will hold a specific value based on the execution of `func_1`. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples with elements from `subs` list and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `y` is the length of `subs`, `subs` is a list with at least one element, `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]`, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is 0**
