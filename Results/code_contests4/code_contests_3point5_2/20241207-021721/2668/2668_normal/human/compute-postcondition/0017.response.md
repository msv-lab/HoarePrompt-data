Postcondition: ***`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, `counts` is a list containing tuples. If `init[i]` is equal to `init[i - 1]`, then a new tuple is appended to `counts` where the first element is one more than the first element of the last tuple in `counts`, and the second element is the element at index `i` in `init`. Otherwise, if `init[i]` is not equal to `init[i - 1]`, a tuple (1, init[0]) is added to `counts` and `i` remains 0 for the next iteration.***
