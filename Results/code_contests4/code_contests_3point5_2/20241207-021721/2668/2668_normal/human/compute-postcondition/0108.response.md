According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `subs`. If `y` is less than the length of `subs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0 and `subs` has at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1 and `subs` should remain with at least 1 element.
State: **`back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains a tuple with elements from `subs` list and `y + 1`, `y` is now 1, `subs` is a list with at least 1 element, and the first element of audio[y] is still equal to the second element of uniques[i]**
