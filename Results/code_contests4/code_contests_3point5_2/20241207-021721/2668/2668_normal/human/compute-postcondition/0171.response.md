Postcondition: ***`res` and `anss` are True, `subs` has at least 1 element, `templis` contains tuples based on conditions, for the loop to execute another time `uniques` has at least 2 elements, `z` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `anss` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[2][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)***
