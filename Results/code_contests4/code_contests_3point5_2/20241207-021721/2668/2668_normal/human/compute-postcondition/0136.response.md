Postcondition: ***`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `audio2`, 0, and `len(audio2) - 1`. If `back[0]` is True, then `back` is the result of `func_1`, `res` is True, `templis` contains tuples with elements from `subs` list and `y + 1` for all valid `y`, `y` is the length of `subs`, `subs` is a list with at least one element, `audio[y][0] == uniques[i][1]`, `uniques` is a list with at least 1 element, `z` is the index of the last element in `uniques`. If any of the `back` elements are True, `anss` is assigned the value of the first True `back` and we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `res` remains True.***
