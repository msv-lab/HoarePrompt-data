Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with parameters `uniques[z][1]`, `templis`, `0`, and `len(templis) - 1`. Since `z` is 0, `uniques[z][1]` refers to the second element of the tuple at index 0 of `uniques`. The function will return a value which will be assigned to the variable `back`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is True, `anss` is "back", `subs` has at least 1 element, `templis` contains tuples based on conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` has at least 1 element, `z` is 0 and `back` is assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`.
Output State: **`res` is True, `anss` is "back", `subs` has at least 1 element, `templis` contains tuples based on conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` has at least 1 element, `z` is 0 and `back` is assigned the return value of `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)`**
