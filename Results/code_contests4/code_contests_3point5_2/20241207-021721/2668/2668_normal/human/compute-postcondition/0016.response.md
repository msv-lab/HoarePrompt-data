Example Answer:
A tuple containing the values (1, init[i]) is appended to the list `counts`. The value of `i` is 0, so the element at index 0 in `init` is considered. Since `init` is sorted in reverse order and not empty, the element at index 0 is different from the element at index -1. Therefore, the tuple (1, init[0]) is appended to `counts`.
Output State: **`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, `counts` contains a tuple (1, init[0]), `i` is 0 and ready for the next iteration**
