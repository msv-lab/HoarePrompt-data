Postcondition: ***`input` is a file object in read mode or `sys.stdin`, `n` is an integer, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, counts is a list containing tuples, uniques is a list containing unique tuples, `audio` is a list of tuples, `subs` is a list of integers, `res` is False, `anss` is 0, `audio2` is a sorted version of the `audio` list, for the loop to execute the first time `uniques` is not empty, `i` is 0. If `res` is True after the loop executes, then `anss` will be updated to the result of `func_1` for the last element of `uniques` that satisfies the condition in the loop. If `res` is False after the loop executes, then `anss` will remain unchanged.***
