According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `init` is not empty. Since `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, the loop will execute until all elements in `init` are iterated. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order and not empty, `counts` is a list containing a tuple**
