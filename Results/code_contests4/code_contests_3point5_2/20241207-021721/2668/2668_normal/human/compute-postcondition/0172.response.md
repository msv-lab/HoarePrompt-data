Output State: **`res` and `anss` are True, `subs` has at least 1 element, `templis` contains tuples based on conditions, `uniques` has been iterated over completely, `z` is the index of the last element in `uniques`, `back` is the result of calling `func_1(uniques[z][1], templis, 0, len(templis) - 1)` which satisfies the condition `back[0]` being True, `anss` is the value of the last `back` that satisfied the condition**
