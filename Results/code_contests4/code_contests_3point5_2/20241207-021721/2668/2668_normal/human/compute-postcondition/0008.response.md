Example Answer:
`counts` is assigned a list containing a tuple with values (1, init[0]). The value of `init` is obtained by splitting the input line, converting each element to an integer, and sorting it in reverse order. The value of `init` is unknown initially, but it is sorted in reverse order. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list containing a tuple.
Output State: **`input` is a file object in read mode or sys.stdin, `n` is an integer read from the input source, `init` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `counts` is a list containing a tuple**
