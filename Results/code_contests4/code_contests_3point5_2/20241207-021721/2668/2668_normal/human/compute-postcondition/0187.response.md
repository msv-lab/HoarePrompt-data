Example Answer:
`back` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with parameters `uniques[i][1]`, `subs`, 0, and `len(subs) - 1`. The value of `res` remains True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`back` is the result of calling `func_1`, `res` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
