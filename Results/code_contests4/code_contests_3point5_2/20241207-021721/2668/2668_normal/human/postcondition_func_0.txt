Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `num`, `lis1`, `low`, and `high`. It iterates through the list `lis1` using binary search to find the value of `num`. If `num` is found, it returns True and the corresponding value from the list. If `num` is not found, it returns False and -1. The functionality does not cover all potential edge cases such as what happens if the list `lis1` is empty or if `low` is greater than `high`.
