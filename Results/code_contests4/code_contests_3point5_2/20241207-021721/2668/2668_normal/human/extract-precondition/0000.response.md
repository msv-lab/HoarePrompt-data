**Precondition:**

- n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).
- a1, a2, ..., an are positive integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) representing the languages known by the scientists.
- m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000).
- b1, b2, ..., bm are positive integers (1 ≤ bj ≤ 109) representing the audio languages of the movies.
- c1, c2, ..., cm are positive integers (1 ≤ cj ≤ 109) representing the subtitles languages of the movies.
- bj ≠ cj for all j (audio and subtitles languages are different for each movie).
