Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, processes the data to find the movie that maximizes the number of very pleased scientists and almost satisfied scientists, and outputs the index of that movie. The program uses binary search in function `func_1` to efficiently find the audio and subtitles languages in the movies list, ensuring that the scientists are satisfied according to the specified conditions.

The program covers all possible cases and scenarios as described in the problem description, ensuring that it always finds the correct movie for the scientists to go to in order to maximize the number of very pleased scientists and almost satisfied scientists.
