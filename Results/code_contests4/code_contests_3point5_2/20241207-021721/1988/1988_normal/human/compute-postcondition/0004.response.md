Example Answer:
`tmp` is appended to the list `data`. The previous state of `data` is an empty list, so after execution, `data` will have one element, which is `tmp`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` has one element which is `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`data` has one element which is `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
