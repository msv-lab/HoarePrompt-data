According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `data` has one element which is `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 and `n` should remain unchanged.
State: **`data` has one element which is `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
