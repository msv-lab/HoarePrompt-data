Example Answer:
Since `data` initially has two elements both being `tmp`, and `tmp` is a map object containing integers parsed from user input, after executing the code `data.append(tmp)`, `tmp` is added to the `data` list. The size of `data` will increase by 1. The value of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` has three elements, `tmp` is a map object containing integers parsed from user input, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`data` has three elements, `tmp` is a map object containing integers parsed from user input, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
