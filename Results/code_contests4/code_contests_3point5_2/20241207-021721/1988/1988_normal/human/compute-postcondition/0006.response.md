Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the result of mapping the input values to integers. The values of `n` and `i` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` has one element which is `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`data` has one element which is `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
