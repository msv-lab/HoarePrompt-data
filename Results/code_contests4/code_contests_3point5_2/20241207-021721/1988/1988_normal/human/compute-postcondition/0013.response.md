Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple datasets where each dataset consists of 10 integers separated by blanks. It stores these integers in a list of lists called `data`. The function does not explicitly return any value. It is important to note that the code uses `input()` and `raw_input()` functions which are not valid in Python 3, so the code may not run as expected in Python 3. **
