According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2.
State: **`data` has two elements, both being `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
