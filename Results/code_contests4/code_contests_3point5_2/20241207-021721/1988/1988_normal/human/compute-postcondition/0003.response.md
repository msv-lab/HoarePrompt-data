Example Answer:
`tmp` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by spaces to integers. Since the input is unknown, the values inside `tmp` are also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`data` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
