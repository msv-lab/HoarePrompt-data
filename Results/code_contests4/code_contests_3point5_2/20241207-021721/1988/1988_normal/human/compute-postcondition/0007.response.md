Example Answer:
The element `tmp` is appended to the list `data`. The initial state has `tmp` as the only element in `data`, and `n` is still greater than or equal to 1. The loop will execute a second time as `i` is 1. After execution, `data` will have `tmp` as the first element and the newly appended `tmp` as the second element.
Output State: **`data` has two elements, both being `tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
