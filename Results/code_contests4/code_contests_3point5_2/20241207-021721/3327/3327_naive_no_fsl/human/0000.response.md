Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of edges that need to be added to make the graph harmonious. It correctly reads the input, constructs the graph, and then iterates through the nodes to identify connected components and find the minimum number of edges needed. The program follows the problem description and handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
