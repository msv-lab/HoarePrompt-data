Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the function described in the problem statement. It seems to be trying to calculate the sum of the function values for all pairs of elements in the given array, but the implementation is incorrect. The logic in the code is quite complex and difficult to follow. 

One potential issue is in the calculation of the function `f(a_i, a_j)` which is supposed to alternate the digits of two numbers. The implementation in the code does not seem to correctly follow the rules described in the problem statement.

Without a clear understanding of the logic and correctness of the function `f(a_i, a_j)`, it is difficult to determine if the program is correct for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed.
