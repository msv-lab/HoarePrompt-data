You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This problem differs from the previous one only in the absence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem.

Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers f(a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - 1} b_q), where a_1 ... a_p and b_1 ... b_q are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros.

In other words, the function f(x, y) alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers x and y by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number y. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below.

For example: $$$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212 f(7777, 888) = 7787878 f(33, 44444) = 4443434 f(555, 6) = 5556 f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$$

Formally,

  * if p ≥ q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = a_1 a_2 ... a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q; 
  * if p < q then f(a_1 ... a_p, b_1 ... b_q) = b_1 b_2 ... b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 ... a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q. 



Mishanya gives you an array consisting of n integers a_i, your task is to help students to calculate ∑_{i = 1}^{n}∑_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j) modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of elements in the array. The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the last item in `l1`, `res` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop. The loop processes the elements in `arr` based on the conditions specified in the loop code, updating `ans` and `res` accordingly. If the loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial values.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an input integer `n`, followed by a list of strings `l1`. It then calculates a result `ans` based on specific conditions involving the elements of `l1` and their lengths. The function prints the final calculated `ans` value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def power(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x = x % p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1 == 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `res` is 1, `x` is updated based on the modulo operation with `p`, `y` is 0
    return res
    #The program returns the value of 'res' which is 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function power accepts three integer parameters: x, y, and p. It calculates x raised to the power of y modulo p and returns the result. The function correctly updates the variables x, y, and res within the loop. However, the function is missing a check for the case when y is not greater than 0, which might lead to unexpected behavior if y is negative or 0. Additionally, the annotations suggest that the value of x after the loop will be the final result, but in reality, the final result is the value of res, which is always 1.

#Function 3:

            x = zs[i] + 1
        
        while True:
            x += x & -x

    return us
    #The program returns the list of n integers 'us' with updated values after all iterations of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count_next_smaller_elements` takes a list of n integers `xs` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ xs[i] ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. It then processes the list to calculate and update a new list of integers `us` based on certain conditions within the loops. Finally, the function returns the updated list `us`. The functionality does not explain the purpose behind the calculations or the expected behavior of the updated list `us`, leaving room for further analysis or clarification.

    return A
    #The program returns the list A containing sign * numb or an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts a positive integer zero and reads a sequence of bytes from standard input. It then processes the bytes to extract integers based on certain conditions, storing them in a list A. For each integer found, it calculates sign * numb and adds it to the list. If the input is not valid, an empty list is returned. The code may not handle cases where the input sequence ends abruptly or contains unexpected characters, potentially leading to incorrect results.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
