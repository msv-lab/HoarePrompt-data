Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One potential issue is in the `func_1` function where the calculation of the result `res` based on the lengths of the input items `item` does not match the formal definitions of the function f(x, y) as described in the problem. The logic within the loop for calculating `res` based on different conditions is not aligned with the expected behavior of the function f(x, y) described in the problem description. This inconsistency could lead to incorrect results for certain input cases.

To determine correctness, we need to carefully analyze the implementation of the function `func_1` and compare it to the formal definitions provided in the problem description. If there are any discrepancies in how the function f(x, y) is implemented in the code compared to the problem description, the correctness of the code will be affected.
