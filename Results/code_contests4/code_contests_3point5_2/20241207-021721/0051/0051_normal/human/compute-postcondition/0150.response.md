According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `res` is updated based on the calculation involving `item`, `x`, `i`, `j`, and `mod`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be greater than or equal to -1.
