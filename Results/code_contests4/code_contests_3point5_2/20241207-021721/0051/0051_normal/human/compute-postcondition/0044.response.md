Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9, the value of `conv` depends on `py2`, `A` is a list containing sign * numb or an empty list, `numb` is updated based on the calculation `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48` if `s[i]` >= `b'0'[0]` or assigned an unspecified value zero if not, `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` == `b'-'[0]` and 1 if not, `i` is the length of `s`. This loop will terminate when the condition within the loop does not hold. Additionally, `s` is a non-empty list and the last element of `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0'***
