Postcondition: ***`xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us`, `i` remain the same as the initial state. If `x` is greater than the length of `ts`, `x` is updated to `x + x & -x`, where `&` is a bitwise AND operator and `-` is the two's complement operator. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
