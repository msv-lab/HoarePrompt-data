Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` to the console. It does not affect any other variables in this case. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the last item in `l1`, `res` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop.**
