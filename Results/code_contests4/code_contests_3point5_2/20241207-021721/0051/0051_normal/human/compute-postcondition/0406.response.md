Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of the count in `arr` at index `i` and the total calculated value `res`, `x` is the length of `item` and `x` is greater than 0 and `x - 1` is a valid index, `res` is the final total calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `res` is updated by adding the product of the integer value at index `j` of `item` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of `(x - j - 1) * 2` modulo `mod`, `res` is updated by adding the product of the integer value at index `j` of `item` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of `(x - j) * 2 - 1` modulo `mod**.
