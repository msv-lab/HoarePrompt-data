According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 0. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `i-1` to 0, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be -1.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final updated value after all iterations of the loop, `i` is at least 1, `j` is -1 for the loop to execute one more time**
