Output State: **`xs` is a list of n integers, `ys` is a sorted list of tuples (x, i), `zs` is a list of n integers, `ts` is a list of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1` where each `ts[x - 1]` has been incremented by the number of times x & -x occurred in the loop, `us` is a list of n integers with updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`, and `x` is updated with the value of `x` after subtracting the result of `x & -x`. If x is less than or equal to 0, the program will have the state described above, `x` is assigned the value `zs[i] + 1`.**
