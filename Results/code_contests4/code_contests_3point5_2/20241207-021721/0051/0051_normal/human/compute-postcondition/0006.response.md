State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers between 1 and 10^9, the value of `conv` depends on the value of `py2`, A is an empty list, `numb` is assigned an unspecified value `zero`, `sign` is set to 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, no states need to be adjusted as it is a while True loop**
