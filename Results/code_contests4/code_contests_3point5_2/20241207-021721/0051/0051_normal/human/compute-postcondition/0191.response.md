Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `res` is updated based on the formula provided, the new value of `x` after decrementing by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **The value of `res` is updated based on the formula provided, the new value of `x` after decrementing by 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
