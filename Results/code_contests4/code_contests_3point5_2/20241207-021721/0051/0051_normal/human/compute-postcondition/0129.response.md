According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, the loop will always execute unless explicitly broken out of. At the end of the last iteration, `xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us`, `i` remain the same as the initial state, and `x` is updated. We need to adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time only if `x` is not greater than the length of `ts`. So, the only state that needs adjustment is `x` to ensure it is not greater than the length of `ts`.
State: **`xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us`, `i` remain the same as the initial state, `x` is updated and for the loop to execute again `x` is not greater than the length of `ts`**
