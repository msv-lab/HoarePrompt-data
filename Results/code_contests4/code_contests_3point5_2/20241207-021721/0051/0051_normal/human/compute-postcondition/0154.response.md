Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value of `ans + arr[i - 1] * res`. The previous values of `ans`, `arr`, `i`, and `res` are unknown, so the output state is: `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `arr`, `i`, and `res`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `arr`, `i`, and `res`**
