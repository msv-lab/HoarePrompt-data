Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the next `item`, `res` is the final calculated value after the loop execution, `x` is assigned the length of the last item in `l1`, `res` is updated based on the calculation in the code snippet, `i` is decremented by 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `x` should be greater than the new value of `i` after decrementing by 1, `res` is updated with the new calculation value**
