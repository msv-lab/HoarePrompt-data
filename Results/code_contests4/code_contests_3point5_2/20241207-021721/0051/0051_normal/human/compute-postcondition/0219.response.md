Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is greater than 1, `res` is updated with the new value calculated by the formula `(res + int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j - 1) * 2, mod)) % mod`, and `res` is updated by performing the calculation `(res + int(item[j]) * pow(10, (x - j) * 2 - 1, mod)) % mod`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be adjusted within the range `x - 1` to 0**
