Example Answer:
`sign` is assigned the value 1. The previous state of `sign` is not mentioned, so after execution, `sign` becomes 1. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater or equal to 1, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9, value of `conv` depends on `py2`, `A` is a list containing sign * numb appended with new value, `numb` is zero, `sign` is 1, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater or equal to 1, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9, value of `conv` depends on `py2`, `A` is a list containing sign * numb appended with new value, `numb` is zero, `sign` is 1, `i` is 3**
