Example Answer:
The value of `j` is increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown. The loop will execute again if `x` is greater than `i+1`. The values of `x` and `i` are not provided, so the conditions for the loop are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `x` is decreased by 1, variable `j` is increased by 1, the loop will execute again if `x` is greater than `i+1`.
Output State: **variable `x` is decreased by 1, variable `j` is increased by 1, the loop will execute again if `x` is greater than `i+1`**
