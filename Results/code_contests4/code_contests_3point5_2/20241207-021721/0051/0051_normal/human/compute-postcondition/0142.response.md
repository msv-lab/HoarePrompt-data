Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since `x` is initially equal to `i`, after the increment `x` will also be equal to the new value of `i`. As `j` is equal to `x - i`, it will also change accordingly. The `res` variable contains the accumulated values from all iterations, but since no new values are added in this code snippet, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is equal to the new value of `i`, `j` is equal to the new value of `x - i`, `res` contains the accumulated values from all iterations.
Output State: **`x` is equal to the new value of `i`, `j` is equal to the new value of `x - i`, `res` contains the accumulated values from all iterations**
