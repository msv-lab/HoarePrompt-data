Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Therefore, to make the loop execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted. The program state remains the same.
State: **`xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us`, `i` remain the same as the initial state**
