According to the code, the loop can execute again if `x` is still greater than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is decreased by 1 twice, and `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is 1, `x` is the length of the next `item`, `res` is the final calculated value after the loop execution, the value at index `i-1` in `arr` is equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value 1, `x` is decreased by 1 twice, `res` is updated based on the given formula, `x` is greater than or equal to 3**
