According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is greater than 1. Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be greater than -1.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the second last item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is greater than 1, `res` is updated based on the calculation in the code snippet, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be greater than -1**
