Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the last item in `l1`, `res` is the final result after all iterations of the loop, `j` is -1, `i` is less than 10. Initially, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. After the if else block executes, all variables retain their initial values, and `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`.***
