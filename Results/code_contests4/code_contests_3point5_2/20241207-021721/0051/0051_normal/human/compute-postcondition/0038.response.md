Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater or equal to 1, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `conv` depends on `py2`, `A` is a list containing sign * numb or an empty list, `numb` is updated based on the calculation `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48` if s[i] == b'-'[0] or assigned an unspecified value zero if not, `sign` is -1 if s[i] == b'-'[0] and 1 if not, `i` is 3.***
