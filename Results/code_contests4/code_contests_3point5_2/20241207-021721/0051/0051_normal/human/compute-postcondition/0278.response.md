According to the code, the loop can execute again if `x` is greater than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the length of the last item in `l1` - 1, and `i` is less than 10. To execute the loop one more time, `x` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `i + 1` to satisfy the condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the last item in `l1` - 1, `res` is the updated value after the calculation in the loop, `i` is less than 10 to execute the loop, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is assigned the value 1**
