Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of the count in `arr` at index `i` and the total calculated value `res`, `res` is the final total calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `res` is updated by adding the product of 2 times the integer value of `item[j]` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of `x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1`, calculated modulo `mod`, `x` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is decremented by 1, `j` is assigned the value 1**
