Output State: **`xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us`, `i` remain the same as the initial state. `x` is assigned the value of `zs[i] + 1` at the end of the loop. For all iterations, `us[i]` is increased by the value of `ts[x - 1]`, where `x` is updated according to the loop logic until `x` becomes greater than the length of `ts`.**
