Output State: `xs` is a list of n integers, `ys` is a sorted list of tuples (x, i), `zs` is a list of n integers, `ts` is a list of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1` where each `ts[x - 1]` has been incremented by the number of times x & -x occurred in the loop, `us` is a list of n integers with updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`, `x` is updated with the value of `x` after subtracting the result of `x & -x`, `x` is assigned the value `zs[i] + 1`, `us[i]` is incremented by the value of `ts[x - 1`. If x is less than or equal to 0, the loop or if statement breaks out. `x` is assigned the value `zs[i] + 1`.
