Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of inputs with at least 1 item, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is updated based on conditions, `i` is within the range of 1 to 10, `x` is within the range of 1 to 10, `res` is 0. If x <= i, `i`, `x`, `res`, and `ans` are updated based on loop conditions, `j` is 0, `res` is updated based on the provided formula, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. If x > i, `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `arr`, `i`, and `res`.***
