Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with at least 10 items, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of the count in `arr` at index `i` and the updated total calculated value `res`, `res` is the final total calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `res` is the total sum after all iterations of the loop, `x` is the length of the last item in `l1`, `i` is 1, `j` is -1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `res` is updated by adding the product of the integer value of `item[j + (x - i)]` and `10` raised to the power of `(i - j - 1) * 2` modulo `mod`.**
