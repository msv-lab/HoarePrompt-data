Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated value after the loop execution, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented to a value greater than the number of items in `l1`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is at least 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to -1, `res` is updated by adding the product of `int(item[j + (x - i)])` and `pow(10, (i - j) * 2 - 1, mod)` with `mod` and taking the modulo of `mod` again.**
