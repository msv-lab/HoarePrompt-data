Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the second last item in `l1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of the count in `arr` at index `i - 1` and the total calculated value `res`, `x` is the length of the second last item in `l1`, `res` is the updated total calculated value after all iterations of the loop. If `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to a new value based on the loop iteration, `x` is assigned the length of the new second last item in `l1`, `res` is recalculated based on the updated values, and `ans` is updated by adding the product of the count in `arr` at the new index `i - 1` and the recalculated total value `res`. `res` is initialized to 0. Additionally, `x` is greater than `i`.***
