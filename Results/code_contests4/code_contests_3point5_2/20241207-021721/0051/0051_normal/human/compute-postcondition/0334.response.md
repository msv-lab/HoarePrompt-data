Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the second last item in `l1`, `ans` is the final calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the second last item in `l1`, `res` is the final calculated value after all iterations of the loop and is 0, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than or equal to `i`, `res` is updated by adding 2 times the integer value of `item[j]` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of (x - i + 2 * (i + 1) - 1) modulo `mod`.**
