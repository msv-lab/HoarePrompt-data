Output State: **`xs` is a list of n integers, `ys` is a sorted list of tuples (x, i), `zs` is a list of n integers, `ts` is a list of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1` where each `ts[x - 1]` has been modified according to the loop logic, `us` is a list of n integers with updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is 0, `x` is 0 after the loop executes completely**
