Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is 10, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated value after the loop execution. If `x` <= `i`, then `ans` is updated with `ans + arr[i - 1] * res` and `i` is set to 10. If `x` > `i`, then `ans` is updated, `i` is decremented, `x` is set to the length of `item`, `j` is updated, and `res` is calculated based on the provided formulas.**
