Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the last item in `l1`, `res` contains the final calculated value after the loop execution. If x <= i, then `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[i - 1]` and `res`. If x > i, then `mod`, `n`, `l1`, `arr`, `item`, `ans`, `x`, `i`, `j`, `res` are updated based on the equations provided in the loop code.***
