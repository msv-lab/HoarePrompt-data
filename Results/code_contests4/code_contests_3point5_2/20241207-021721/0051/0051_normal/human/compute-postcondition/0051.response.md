According to the code, the loop will continue indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`xs` is a list of n integers, `ys` is a sorted list of tuples (x, i), `zs` is a list of n integers, `ts` is a list of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1` where `ts[x - 1]` has been incremented by 1, `us` is a list of n integers with updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `len(xs) - 1`, `x` is 0 after the loop executes completely.**
