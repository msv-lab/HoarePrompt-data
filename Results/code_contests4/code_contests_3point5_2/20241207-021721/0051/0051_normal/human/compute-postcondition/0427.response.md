According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x` and `i`. If `x` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is decremented by 1 and `j` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop executes again, `x` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `i` after being decremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is decremented by 1, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `x` is greater than `i` after decrementing by 1**
