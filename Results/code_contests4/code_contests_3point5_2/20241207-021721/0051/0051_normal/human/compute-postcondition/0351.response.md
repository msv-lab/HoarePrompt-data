Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the second last item in `l1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of the count in `arr` at index `i - 1` and the total calculated value `res`, `x` is the length of the second last item in `l1`, `res` is the updated total calculated value after all iterations of the loop. If `arr[i - 1]` is equal to 0, `x` is assigned the length of `item`. `res` is updated based on the given formula `ans = ans + arr[i - 1] * res`.***
