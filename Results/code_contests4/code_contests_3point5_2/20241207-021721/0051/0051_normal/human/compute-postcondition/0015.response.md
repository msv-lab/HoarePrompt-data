Example Answer:
`numb` is assigned the value `zero`, where `zero` is unspecified and the previous value of `numb` is unknown. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers between 1 and 10^9, conv is dependent on py2, A is a list containing the result of sign * numb, sign is set to 1, i is 0, s[i] is less than b'0'[0], s[i] is not equal to b'-'[0], s[i] is not equal to b'\r'[0].
Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers between 1 and 10^9, conv is dependent on py2, A is a list containing the result of sign * numb, numb is assigned an unspecified value zero, sign is set to 1, i is 0, s[i] is less than b'0'[0], s[i] is not equal to b'-'[0], s[i] is not equal to b'\r'[0]**
