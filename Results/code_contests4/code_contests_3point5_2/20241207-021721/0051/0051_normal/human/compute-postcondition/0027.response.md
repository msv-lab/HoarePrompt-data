Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater or equal to 1, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9. The value of `conv` depends on the value of `py2`. `A` is a list containing sign * numb or an empty list. `numb` is updated based on the calculation `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48` or assigned an unspecified value zero. `sign` is either -1 or 1. `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to b'\r'[0], `numb` is 0 and `sign` is 1. The loop can be executed again by incrementing the value of `i`.***
