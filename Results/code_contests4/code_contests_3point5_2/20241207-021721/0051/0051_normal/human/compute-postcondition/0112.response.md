Example Answer:
The value at index `i` of list `us` is incremented by the value at index `x - 1` of list `ts`. The initial states indicate that `xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us`, `i` remain the same. After the execution, the affected variable is `us`. Therefore, the Output State is: `xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us` remain the same, and the value at index `i` of list `us` is incremented by the value at index `x - 1` of list `ts`.
Output State: **`xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us` remain the same, and the value at index `i` of list `us` is incremented by the value at index `x - 1` of list `ts`**
