Postcondition: ***`xs` is a list of n integers, `ys` is a sorted list of tuples (x, i), `zs` is a list of n integers, `ts` is a list of length `zs[ys[-1][1]] + 1` where each `ts[x - 1]` has been incremented by the number of times x & -x occurred in the loop, `us` is a list of n integers with updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `len(xs) - 2`, `x` is the updated value after executing the code x += x & -x. The program remains in the same state as no changes occur when x is greater than the length of ts.***
