Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `x` is unknown, so after execution, `x` will be reduced by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `res` is updated based on the formula provided and the new value of `x` after decrementing by 1.
Output State: **The value of `res` is updated based on the formula provided and the new value of `x` after decrementing by 1.**
