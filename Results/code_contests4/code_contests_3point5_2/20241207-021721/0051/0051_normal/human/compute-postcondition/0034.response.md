Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater or equal to 1, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` are integers between 1 and 10^9, value of `conv` depends on `py2`, `A` is a list containing sign * numb appended with new value, `numb` is updated based on the calculation `10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48` or assigned an unspecified value zero, `sign` is either -1 or 1, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute again `i` needs to be incremented**
