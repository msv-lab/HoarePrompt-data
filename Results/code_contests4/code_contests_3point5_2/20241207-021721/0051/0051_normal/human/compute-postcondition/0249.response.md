Output State: **`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final calculated value after the loop execution, `i` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to -1 for the loop to execute a second time. `res` is updated by adding the product of `int(item[j + (x - i)])` and `pow(10, (i - j - 1) * 2, mod)` modulo `mod`.**
