According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely unless a break statement is encountered or a condition is met to exit the loop. In this case, the loop will execute one more time if no break statement is encountered within the loop body.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`xs`, `ys`, `zs`, `ts`, `us`, `i` remain the same as the initial state for the loop to execute one more time**
