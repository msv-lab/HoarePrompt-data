Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts a positive integer zero and reads a sequence of bytes from standard input. It then processes the bytes to extract integers based on certain conditions, storing them in a list A. For each integer found, it calculates sign * numb and adds it to the list. If the input is not valid, an empty list is returned. The code may not handle cases where the input sequence ends abruptly or contains unexpected characters, potentially leading to incorrect results.**
