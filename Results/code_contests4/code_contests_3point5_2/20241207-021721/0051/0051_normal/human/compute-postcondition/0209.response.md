Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is the calculated result based on the conditions in the loop, `x` is the length of the next `item`, `res` is the final calculated value after the loop execution. If `x` is less than or equal to 11, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `arr[10]` and `res`. Otherwise, if `x` is equal to 11, `res` is updated based on the given formula and all iterations of the loop have executed. Finally, `res` is updated with the new calculated value after applying the formula multiple times. `ans` is incremented by the product of `arr[10]` and `res`.***
