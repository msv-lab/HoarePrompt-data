Postcondition: ***`mod` is 998244353, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 10, `l1` is a list of inputs with `n` items and is not empty, `arr` contains a count of items of each length from 1 to 10, `item` is the last item in `l1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of the count in `arr` at index `i` and the total calculated value `res`, `x` is the length of `item`, `res` is the final total calculated value after all iterations of the loop, `res` is the sum of the calculations involving `item`, `j`, `x`, and `mod`. If `x <= i`, the loop continues with the current values of all variables. If `x > i`, all variables maintain their initial values after the loop execution.***
