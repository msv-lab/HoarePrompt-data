Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the function f(x, y) as described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of f(a_i, a_j) for all pairs of elements in the input array and prints the result modulo 998244353. The implementation of the function f(x, y) handles cases where the lengths of the numbers x and y are not equal, and the algorithm for calculating the result is correct based on the given formula. The program also correctly reads the input and handles the output format. Overall, the program seems to be correctly solving the problem as described.
