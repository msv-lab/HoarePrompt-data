Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the maze dimensions, starting and ending positions, and the maze itself.
2. The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and data structures.
3. The program performs a breadth-first search to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination from the starting position.
4. The program correctly handles the constraints where the magician cannot go out of the maze and the starting and ending positions are valid.
5. The program outputs the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination or -1 if it is not possible to reach the destination.
