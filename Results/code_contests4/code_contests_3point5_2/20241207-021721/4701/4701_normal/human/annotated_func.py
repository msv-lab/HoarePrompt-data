#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for a grid, starting and goal positions, then performs a search algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and goal positions in the grid. It prints the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal position from the start position. If the goal position is unreachable, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output.
