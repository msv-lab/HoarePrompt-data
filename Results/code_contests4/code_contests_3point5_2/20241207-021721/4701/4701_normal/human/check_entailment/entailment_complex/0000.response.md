Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The annotated program reads the input values for the grid, starting position, and goal position. It then performs a search algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and goal positions in the grid. The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description, such as moving vertically or horizontally adjacent and using magic to warp. It accurately calculates the minimum number of times the magician needs to use magic to reach the goal position. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where the goal position is unreachable and prints -1 in such scenarios. Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible cases.
