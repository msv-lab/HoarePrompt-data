Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values correctly and initializes the necessary variables based on the problem description. It then uses a breadth-first search approach to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the destination (D_h, D_w) from the starting point (C_h, C_w) while avoiding walls represented by '#'. If the destination is unreachable, it prints -1 as required.

The program correctly implements the two kinds of moves allowed for the magician, Move A and Move B, and ensures that the magician stays within the bounds of the maze.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for different maze configurations and starting/ending points.
