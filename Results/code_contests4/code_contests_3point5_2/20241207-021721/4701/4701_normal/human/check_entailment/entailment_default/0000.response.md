Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for the grid, starting and goal positions.
- It uses a search algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and goal positions in the grid.
- The output of the code is the minimum number of steps required to reach the goal position from the start position, which aligns with the problem description.
- If the goal position is unreachable, the code correctly prints -1 as specified in the problem description.
- The code properly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
