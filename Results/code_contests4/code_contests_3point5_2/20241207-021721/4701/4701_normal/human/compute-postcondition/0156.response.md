Example Answer:
`u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. The previous values of `x`, `w`, and `y` are not provided, so the output state will depend on the values of those variables. If `pu` is equal to `goal`, the states remain the same. Otherwise, if `pu` is not equal to `goal`, the states of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are affected by the calculation of `u`.
Output State: **If `pu` is equal to `goal`, the states remain the same. Otherwise, if `pu` is not equal to `goal`, the states of `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are affected by the calculation of `u`.**
