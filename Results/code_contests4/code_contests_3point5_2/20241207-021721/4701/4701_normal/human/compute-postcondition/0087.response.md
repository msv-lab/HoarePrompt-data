According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` in the range from -2 to 2 inclusive. Initially, `j` is 3. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `j` should be within the range of -2 to 2 inclusive. Additionally, since the condition for the loop execution one more time is `i` being 4, and `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, it needs to be added to the state as well.

State: **`j` is within the range of -2 to 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop for both cases if not i == j == 0, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 4**
