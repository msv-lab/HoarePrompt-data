Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy`. After execution, `x` and `y` will have new values calculated from the sum of `ux + xx` and `uy + yy`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, if `pu` is equal to `goal`, the states will remain the same. Otherwise, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are lists with equal lengths and at least 1 element each.
