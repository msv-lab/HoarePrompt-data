Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the list `dx`, where `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, `i` cannot be appended to `dx`. The other variables are not affected. Since `i` is not defined, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is 3, `vvs` has a new element 1 appended based on the condition abs(i) + abs(j) > 1**
