Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `dx`. The previous state of `dx` is not provided, but we know that `i` is not equal to 0. Therefore, after execution, `dx` will contain the value of `i`. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`h`, `w`, `dh`, `dw`, `ch`, `cw`, `rows`, `cols`, `OK`, `NG`, `ns`, `ss`, `n`, `start`, `goal`, `seen`, `q`, `dy`, `vvs`, `j` are as described in the precondition, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, `dx` contains the value of `i`.**
