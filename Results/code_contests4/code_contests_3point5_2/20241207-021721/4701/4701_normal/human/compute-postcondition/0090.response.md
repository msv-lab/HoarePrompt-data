Output State: **`j` contains values in the range of -2 to 2 and the newly appended value, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop for both cases if not i == j == 0, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 4, i is not equal to 0 and j is not equal to 0, `dx` contains the value of `i`.**
