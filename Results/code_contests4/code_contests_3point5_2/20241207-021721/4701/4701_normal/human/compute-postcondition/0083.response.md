Postcondition: ***`j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1. Otherwise, `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop without the additional value. `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop for both cases.***
