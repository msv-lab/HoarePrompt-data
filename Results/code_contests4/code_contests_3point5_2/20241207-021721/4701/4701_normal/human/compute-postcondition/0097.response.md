According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `j`, `i`, `dy`, `vvs`, and `dx`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within the range of -2 to 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop, and `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0. 

To execute the loop one more time with `i` being 4, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` should be updated to 4
- `dx` should contain the value of `i`, so `dx` should be updated to 4
- If abs(i) + abs(j) is greater than 1, `vvs` should be appended with an additional value of 1
- If abs(i) + abs(j) is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` should be appended with the value 0

State: **`j` is within the range of -2 to 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` contains the value of 4, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 4**
