Example Answer:
`ch` and `cw` are assigned the integer values obtained by mapping the input split by space. The values of `ch` and `cw` depend on the input provided. 
Output State: **`input` lambda function is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9, `h` is assigned the integer value obtained from input split by space, `w` is assigned the integer value obtained from input split by space.**
