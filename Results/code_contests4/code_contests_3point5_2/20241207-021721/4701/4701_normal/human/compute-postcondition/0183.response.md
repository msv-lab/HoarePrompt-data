Output State: **If `pu` is equal to `goal`, all variables will remain unchanged. If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, `num` will be updated to `pnum + vv` based on the loop code. Additionally, if the conditions specified in the if statement are met, `seen[u]` will be updated to `num` and `hp(q, (num, u))` will be executed. The values of `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop.**
