Postcondition: ***`j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3], `vvs` and `dx` have elements appended based on the condition in the loop, all other variables retain their previous values. If not `i` is equal to `j` is equal to 0, and the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is greater than 1, `vvs` has an element appended with 1. If the absolute value of `i` plus the absolute value of `j` is less than or equal to 1, `vvs` and `dx` have elements appended based on the condition in the loop.***
