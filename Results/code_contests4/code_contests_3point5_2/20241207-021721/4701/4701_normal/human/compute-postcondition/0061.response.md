According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of -2 to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3.
State: **`j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], `vvs` has elements appended based on the condition in the loop, all other variables retain their previous values**
