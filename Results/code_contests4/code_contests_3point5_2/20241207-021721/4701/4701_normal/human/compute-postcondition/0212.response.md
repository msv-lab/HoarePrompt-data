Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, where `pnum`, `vv`, and `num` are values that are not explicitly provided in the initial state. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, and there are more elements in the zip(dx, dy, vvs) iterable. Variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`.
Output State: **`num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`, and there are more elements in the zip(dx, dy, vvs) iterable. Variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`**
