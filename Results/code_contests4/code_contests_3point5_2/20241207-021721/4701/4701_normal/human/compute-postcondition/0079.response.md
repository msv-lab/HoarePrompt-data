Example Answer:
`dx` appends the value of `i` to the list `dx`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value being appended. The output state is: `j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop.
Output State: **`j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop**
