According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `rows`. If `i` is less than `rows`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `rows` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and for the loop to execute again, `rows` must be greater than 2.
State: **`h` is assigned an integer value obtained from input split by space, `w` is assigned an integer value obtained from input split by space, `dh` is an integer determined by input - 1, `dw` is an integer determined by input - 1, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, `cols` is assigned the value of `w`, `OK` is assigned the string '.', `NG` is assigned the string '#', `ns` is initialized as a defaultdict containing sets, `ss` is a list of size `rows` filled with None, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is assigned the input value, `ss[i]` is assigned the value of `s` for the loop to execute a second time, `s` is assigned the input value, `ss[i]` is assigned the value of `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `rows` must be greater than 2**.
