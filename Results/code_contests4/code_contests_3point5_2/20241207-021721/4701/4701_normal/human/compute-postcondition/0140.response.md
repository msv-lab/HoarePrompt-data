Example Answer: 
The values of `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `ux` and `yy` respectively. The initial state of `x` and `y` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen[u]` is unchanged, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements left in dx, dy, and vvs lists, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `ux` and `yy` respectively.
Output State: **`seen[u]` is unchanged, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements left in dx, dy, and vvs lists, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `ux` and `yy` respectively**
