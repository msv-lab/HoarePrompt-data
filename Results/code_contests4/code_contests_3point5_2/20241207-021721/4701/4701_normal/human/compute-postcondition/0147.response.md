Postcondition: ***`seen[u]` is unchanged, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `ux` and `yy` respectively, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program reaches this block. If `seen[u]` is None or `seen[u]` is greater than `num`, `seen[u]` is assigned the value `num`.***
