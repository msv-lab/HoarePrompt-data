Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`. Since `j` is within the range of -2 to 2, the list `dy` now contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is within the range of -2 to 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` contains the value of 4, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 4, `dx` now contains [4, 4].
Output State: **`j` is within the range of -2 to 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` contains the value of 4, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 4, `dx` now contains [4, 4]**
