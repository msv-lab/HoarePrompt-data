Example Answer:
The variables `x` and `y` are updated to the sum of `ux + xx` and `uy + yy` respectively. The previous values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are unknown, so the output state is: If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, `num` is updated to `pnum + vv`. Either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'. If `(seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num)` is true, the loop can execute one more time. 
Output State: **If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, `num` is updated to `pnum + vv`. Either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'. If `(seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num)` is true, the loop can execute one more time.**
