Example Answer:
The value of `j` is appended to the list `dy`, so the list `dy` will now contain the value 3. The condition abs(i) + abs(j) > 1 is not met as abs(3) + abs(3) is equal to 6 which is not greater than 1, so no new element is appended to `vvs`. All other variables retain their previous values.
Output State: **All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is 3, `dy` contains 3, `vvs` has no new elements appended**
