Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux + xx` and `uy + yy` respectively. The previous values of `ux`, `uy`, `xx`, and `yy` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv, x and y are updated integers, h and w are integers, ss is a 2D list of characters, seen[u] is now equal to `num` if seen[u] is None or greater than `num`.
Output State: **`num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv, x and y are updated integers, h and w are integers, ss is a 2D list of characters, seen[u] is now equal to `num` if seen[u] is None or greater than `num`**
