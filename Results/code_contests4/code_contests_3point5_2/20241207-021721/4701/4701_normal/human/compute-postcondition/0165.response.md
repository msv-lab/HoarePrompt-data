According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `pu`, `goal`, `num`, `pnum`, `vv`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `w`, `ss`, `seen`, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs`. Here are the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

1. If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, update `num` to `pnum + vv`.
2. Either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'.
3. If `(seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num)` is true, then the postcondition is satisfied, and the program variables retain their updated values based on the conditions specified in the if statement.

State: **If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, `num` is updated to `pnum + vv`. Either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'. If `(seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num)` is true, the loop can execute one more time.**
