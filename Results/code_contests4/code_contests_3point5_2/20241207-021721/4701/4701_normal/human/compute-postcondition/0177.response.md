Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, where the values of `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remain unchanged. Therefore, after execution, the value of `num` is `pnum + vv`. The value of `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, but the values of `x`, `w`, and `y` are not given. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remain unchanged, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **The values of `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remain unchanged, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
