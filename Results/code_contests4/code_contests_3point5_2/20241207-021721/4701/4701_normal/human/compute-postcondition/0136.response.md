Example Answer:
`seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`. The value of `seen[u]` is updated based on the value of `num`, but the overall output state remains the same regardless of the conditions met in the if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the output state regardless of the conditions met in the if statement.
Output State: **No change in the output state regardless of the conditions met in the if statement**
