Postcondition: ***After the loop finishes executing, `seen` will contain the minimum `num` value for each `u`, `x` and `y` will be updated based on the values of `ux`, `xx`, `uy`, and `yy`, `u` will be calculated as `x * w + y`, and the conditions for updating `seen[u]` will be based on the values of `num` and `seen[u]`. The loop control variable `q` will be False, as the loop terminates when `pu` is equal to `goal`. `val` is assigned the value of `seen[goal]`. Additionally, `val` is not None.***
