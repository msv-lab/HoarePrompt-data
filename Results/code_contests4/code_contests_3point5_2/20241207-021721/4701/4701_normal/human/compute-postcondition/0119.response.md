According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` being zipped together. The loop can execute if all three lists have the same length. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **After the execution of the if block, `j` will be in the range of -3 to 2, `dy` will contain values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` will have elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` will contain the value of 4 repeatedly, `q` will still evaluate to True, `pnum` and `pu` will have the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux, uy` will be determined by `divmod(pu, w)` operation, and `pu` will be equal to `goal` after the execution of the if block, for the loop to execute `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must have the same length.**
