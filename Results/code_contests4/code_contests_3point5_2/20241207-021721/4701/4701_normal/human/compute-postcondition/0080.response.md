Example Answer:
`j` is appended to the list `dy`, so after execution, `dy` will contain [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3]. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop.
Output State: **`j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop**
