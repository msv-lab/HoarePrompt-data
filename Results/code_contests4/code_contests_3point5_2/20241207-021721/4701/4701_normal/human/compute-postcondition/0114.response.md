Example Answer:
`pnum` and `pu` are assigned the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `j` in the range of -3 to 2, `dy` containing values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` having elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` containing the value of 4 repeatedly, and `q` evaluating to True. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, `j` will be in the range of -3 to 2, `dy` will contain values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` will have elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` will contain the value of 4 repeatedly, `q` will still evaluate to True, `pnum` and `pu` will have the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`.
Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `j` will be in the range of -3 to 2, `dy` will contain values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` will have elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` will contain the value of 4 repeatedly, `q` will still evaluate to True, `pnum` and `pu` will have the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`**
