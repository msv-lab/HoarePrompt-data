Example Answer:
The value of `u` is calculated by multiplying `x` with `w` and adding `y`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `w` are unchanged. After the calculation, `u` will hold the new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen[u]` is unchanged, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements left in dx, dy, and vvs lists, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `ux` and `yy` respectively, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`.
