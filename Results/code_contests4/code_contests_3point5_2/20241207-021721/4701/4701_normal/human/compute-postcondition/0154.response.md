According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` lists to zip together. If the lengths of the lists are equal and at least 1, the loop will execute. Additionally, `pu` and `goal` need to be equal after the loop finishes for no changes to occur.

State: **After the loop finishes executing, if `pu` is equal to `goal`, the states will remain the same. Otherwise, `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` are lists with equal lengths and at least 1 element each.**
