Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop (either additional values or just 0 depending on the execution path), `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop. All other variables retain their previous values. The program updates `dy` with an additional element 4, `vvs` gets updated based on the loop condition, and `dx` is appended accordingly.***
