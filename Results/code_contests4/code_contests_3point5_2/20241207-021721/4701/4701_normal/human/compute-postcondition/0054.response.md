Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is -2 and `dy` contains 3. By appending `j` to `dy`, the new value of `dy` will be [3, -2]. The element appended to `dy` depends on the value of `j`, which is -2. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is -2, `dy` contains [3, -2], `vvs` has an element appended with a value of 0 or 1 depending on the condition.
Output State: **All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is -2, `dy` contains [3, -2], `vvs` has an element appended with a value of 0 or 1 depending on the condition.**
