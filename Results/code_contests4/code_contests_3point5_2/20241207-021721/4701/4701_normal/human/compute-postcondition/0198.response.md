Output State: **`num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, x and y are integers, h and w are integers, ss is a 2D list of characters. If x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or ss[x][y] == '#', the program does not modify any variables and exits the if statement without any changes. Additionally, either seen[u] is None or seen[u] is greater than `num`. `seen[u]` is now equal to `num`.**
