Postcondition: ***If `pu` is equal to `goal`, the states remain the same. If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, `num` is updated to `pnum + vv`. Additionally, either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'. Finally, if `(seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num)` is true, then the postcondition is satisfied, and the program variables retain their updated values based on the conditions specified in the if statement.***
