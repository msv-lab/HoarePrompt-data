Example Answer:
`vvs` is appended with the value 1. The previous states of `j` is 4, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 4, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop.
Output State: **`j` is 4, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop.**
