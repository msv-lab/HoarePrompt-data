Postcondition: ***All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is -2, `dy` contains [3, -2], `vvs` has an element appended with a value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `vvs` now contains [3, -2, 1]. If abs(i) + abs(j) is not greater than 1, `vvs` has an element appended with a value of 0 or 1 depending on the condition.***
