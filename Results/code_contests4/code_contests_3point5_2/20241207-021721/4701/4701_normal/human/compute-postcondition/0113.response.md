According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `q` evaluates to True. Right before the loop, the states are as follows: `j` will be in the range of -2 to 2, `dy` will contain values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` will have elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` will contain the value of 4 repeatedly.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **After the loop finishes executing, `j` will be in the range of -3 to 2, `dy` will contain values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` will have elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` will contain the value of 4 repeatedly, `q` will still evaluate to True**
