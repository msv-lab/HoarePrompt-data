Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The previous values of `pnum` and `vv` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen[u]` is unchanged, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements left in dx, dy, and vvs lists, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `ux` and `yy` respectively, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`.
