Postcondition: ***`j` is in the range of -3 to 2, `dy` contains values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` has elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` contains the value of 4 repeatedly, `q` still evaluates to True, `pnum` and `pu` have the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux, uy` are determined by `divmod(pu, w)` operation, `pu` is equal to `goal`, for the loop to execute `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must have the same length, `x, y` are assigned the values `ux + xx, uy + yy`, and `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`, `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and the condition `(x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or (y >= w) or (ss[x][y] == '#'))` is satisfied***
