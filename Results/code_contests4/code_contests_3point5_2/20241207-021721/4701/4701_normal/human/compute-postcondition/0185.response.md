Example Answer:
`pnum` and `pu` are assigned the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`. The values of `pnum` and `pu` will depend on the execution of `hpp(q)`. If `pu` is equal to `goal`, all variables will remain unchanged. If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` is not empty and the necessary updates to `num` and `seen[u]` have been made based on the loop code. Therefore, the Output State is: variables are updated based on the function `hpp(q)` and loop conditions.
Output State: **variables are updated based on the function `hpp(q)` and loop conditions**
