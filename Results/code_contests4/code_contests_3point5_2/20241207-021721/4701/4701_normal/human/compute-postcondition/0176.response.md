Example Answer:
The value of `u` is assigned the result of `x * w + y`, where the values of `x`, `w`, and `y` are unknown. Since the initial state of `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remains unchanged, the output state after executing the code is the same as the initial state with the addition of `u` being calculated by `x * w + y`.
Output State: **The values of `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remain unchanged, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`.**
