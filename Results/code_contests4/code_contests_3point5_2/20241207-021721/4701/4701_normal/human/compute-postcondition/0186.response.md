Example Answer:
The values of `ux` and `uy` are updated by dividing the value of `pu` by `w` and storing the quotient in `ux` and the remainder in `uy`. The previous values of `pu` and `w` are unknown, so the output state is: variables `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the result of `divmod(pu, w)`.
Output State: **variables `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the result of `divmod(pu, w)`**
