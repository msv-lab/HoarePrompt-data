Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: j is in the range of -3 to 2, dy contains values ranging from -2 to 4, vvs has elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, dx contains the value of 4 repeatedly, q still evaluates to True, pnum and pu have the values returned by the function hpp(q), ux and uy are determined by divmod(pu, w) operation, and pu is equal to goal and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
