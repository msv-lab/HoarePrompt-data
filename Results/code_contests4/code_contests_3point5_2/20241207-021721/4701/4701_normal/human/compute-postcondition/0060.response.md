According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified by `i` which is from -2 to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], and `vvs` has elements appended based on the loop body. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 3. 
State: **All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], `vvs` has elements appended based on the condition in the loop. For the loop to execute one more time `i` will be 3**
