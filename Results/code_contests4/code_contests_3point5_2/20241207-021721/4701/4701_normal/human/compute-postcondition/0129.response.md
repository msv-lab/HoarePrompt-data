Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `j` will be in the range of -3 to 2, `dy` will contain values ranging from -2 to 4, `vvs` will have elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` will contain the value of 4 repeatedly, `q` will still evaluate to True, `pnum` and `pu` will have the values returned by the function `hpp(q)`, `ux, uy` will be determined by `divmod(pu, w)` operation, `pu` will be equal to `goal`, for the loop to execute `dx`, `dy`, and `vvs` must have the same length, `x, y` will be assigned the values `ux + xx, uy + yy`, and `u` will be calculated as `x * w + y`, `num` will be assigned the value of `pnum + vv`, and if `seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num`, then the value of `seen[u]` will be updated to `num`.***
