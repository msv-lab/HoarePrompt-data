Example Answer:
`ux, uy` are assigned the quotient and remainder of `pu` divided by `w` using the `divmod` function. The previous values of `pu` and `w` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, the states will remain the same.
Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, the states will remain the same**
