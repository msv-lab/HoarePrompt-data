Postcondition: ***j is in the range of -3 to 2, dy contains values ranging from -2 to 4, vvs has elements based on the condition in the loop with additional values of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, dx contains the value of 4 repeatedly, q still evaluates to True, pnum and pu have the values returned by the function hpp(q), ux and uy are determined by divmod(pu, w) operation, and pu is equal to goal***
