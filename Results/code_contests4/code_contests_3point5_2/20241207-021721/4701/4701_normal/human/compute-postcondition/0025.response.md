Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the product of `rows` and `cols`. The values of `rows` and `cols` are determined by `h` and `w`, so `n` is the product of `h` and `w`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is assigned an integer value obtained from input split by space, `w` is assigned an integer value obtained from input split by space, `dh` is an integer determined by input - 1, `dw` is an integer determined by input - 1, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, `cols` is assigned the value of `w`, `OK` is assigned the string '.', `NG` is assigned the string '#', `ns` is initialized as a defaultdict containing sets, `ss` is a list of size `rows` filled with the input values, and `n` is the product of `h` and `w`.
Output State: **`h` is assigned an integer value obtained from input split by space, `w` is assigned an integer value obtained from input split by space, `dh` is an integer determined by input - 1, `dw` is an integer determined by input - 1, `ch` is decremented by 1, `cw` is decremented by 1, `rows` is assigned the value of `h`, `cols` is assigned the value of `w`, `OK` is assigned the string '.', `NG` is assigned the string '#', `ns` is initialized as a defaultdict containing sets, `ss` is a list of size `rows` filled with the input values, `n` is the product of `h` and `w`**
