According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 3. Hence, for the next iteration of the loop:
State: **`j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop**
