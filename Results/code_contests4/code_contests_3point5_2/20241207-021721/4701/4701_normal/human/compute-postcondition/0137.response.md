Example Answer:
The function `hp` is called with arguments `q` and a tuple `(num, u)`. The values of `q`, `num`, and `u` are unknown and the output state does not change regardless of the conditions met in the if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the output state regardless of the conditions met in the if statement.
Output State: **No change in the output state regardless of the conditions met in the if statement**
