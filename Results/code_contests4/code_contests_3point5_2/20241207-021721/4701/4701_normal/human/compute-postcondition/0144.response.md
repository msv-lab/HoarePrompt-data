Postcondition: ***`seen[u]` is unchanged, for the loop to execute another time there must be more elements left in dx, dy, and vvs lists, `x` and `y` are updated by adding `ux` and `xx` to `ux` and `yy` respectively, `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program reaches this block.***
