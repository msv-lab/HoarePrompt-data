According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. The loop starts with `j` being -2, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 2.
State: **All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is -2, `dy` contains 3, `vvs` has an element appended. If abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `vvs` contains an additional element with a value of 1. Otherwise, `vvs` remains the same but with an extra element having a value of 0.**
