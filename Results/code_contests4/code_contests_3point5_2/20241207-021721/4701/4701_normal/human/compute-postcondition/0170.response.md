Postcondition: ***The value of `num` is dependent on the values of `pnum` and `vv`. If x is less than 0, y is less than 0, x is greater than or equal to h, y is greater than or equal to w, or ss[x][y] == '#', then we continue to the next iteration. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `num`, `pnum`, or `vv`.***
