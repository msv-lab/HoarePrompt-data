Example Answer:
The value of `u` is calculated as `x * w + y`. The variables `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers. The value of `num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`. The list `seen` is updated such that `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`. 
Output State: **`num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`.**
