Output State: **At the end of the loop, `num` is assigned the final result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters. `seen[u]` is now equal to the minimum `num` value encountered during the loop execution. Variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. If any of the conditions `x < 0` or `y < 0` or `x >= h` or `y >= w` or `ss[x][y] == '#'` are met, the program does not modify any variables and moves to the next iteration.**
