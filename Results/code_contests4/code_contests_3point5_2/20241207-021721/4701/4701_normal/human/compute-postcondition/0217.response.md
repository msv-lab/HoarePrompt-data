Postcondition: ***`num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters. `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`. Variable `u` is assigned the value of `x * w + y`. If `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#', then the program updates the variables and conditions mentioned above.***
