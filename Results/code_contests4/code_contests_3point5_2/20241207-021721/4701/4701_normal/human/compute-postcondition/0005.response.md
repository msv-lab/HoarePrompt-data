Example Answer:
`dh` and `dw` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input by space. The values of `dh` and `dw` are determined by the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` lambda function is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9, `h` is assigned the integer value obtained from input split by space, `w` is assigned the integer value obtained from input split by space, `dh` is an integer determined by input, `dw` is an integer determined by input.
Output State: **`input` lambda function is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9, `h` is assigned the integer value obtained from input split by space, `w` is assigned the integer value obtained from input split by space, `dh` is an integer determined by input, `dw` is an integer determined by input**
