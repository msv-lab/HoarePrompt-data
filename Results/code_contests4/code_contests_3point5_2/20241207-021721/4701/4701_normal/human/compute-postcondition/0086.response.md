According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.

State: **`j` is 3, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` is appended based on the condition in the loop for both cases if not i == j == 0, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be 4**
