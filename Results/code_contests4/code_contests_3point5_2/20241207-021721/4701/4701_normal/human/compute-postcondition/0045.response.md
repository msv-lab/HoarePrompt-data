According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `vvs`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables retain their previous values except for `j` and `vvs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range (-2, 3) which is 3. 

Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop, it can retain its previous value. And for `vvs`, a new element needs to be appended based on the condition abs(i) + abs(j) > 1. So, the new element appended to `vvs` should be 1.

State: **All variables retain their previous values except for `j` which is 3, `vvs` has a new element 1 appended based on the condition abs(i) + abs(j) > 1**
