Example Answer:
The function hp(q, (num, u)) is called with the parameters (num, u). The variables `num` and `u` are passed as arguments to the function. The values of `num` and `u` are already determined in the initial state, so they are passed as they are. The function hp(q, (num, u)) is executed with these parameters. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as the condition x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#' holds true. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`.
Output State: **`num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`**
