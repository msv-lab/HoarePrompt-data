Example Answer: 
The values of the variables `ux` and `uy` do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `ux` and `uy` are updated based on the result of `divmod(pu, w)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`ux` and `uy` are updated based on the result of `divmod(pu, w)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
