Example Answer: 
The lambda function `write` is defined to take a string input `x` and write it to the standard output with a newline character. The recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` lambda function is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9.
Output State: **`input` lambda function is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9**
