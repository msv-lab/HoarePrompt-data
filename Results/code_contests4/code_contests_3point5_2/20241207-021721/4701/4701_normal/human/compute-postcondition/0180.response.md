Example Answer:
`seen[u]` is assigned the value of `num`. If any of the conditions x < 0, y < 0, x >= h, y >= w, or ss[x][y] == '#' hold true, the program continues execution without any changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remain unchanged. `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`.
Output State: **`num`, `pnum`, and `vv` remain unchanged. `num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`**
