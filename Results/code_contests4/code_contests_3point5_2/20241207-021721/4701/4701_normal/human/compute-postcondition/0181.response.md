Example Answer:
The function hp is called with arguments q and a tuple containing the values of num and u. Since num is assigned the value of pnum + vv, the value of num can be calculated by adding the previous values of pnum and vv. The values of pnum and vv remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: num is the result of pnum + vv, pnum, and vv remain unchanged.
Output State: **num is the result of pnum + vv, pnum, and vv remain unchanged**
