Postcondition: ***`j` is within the range of -2 to 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` contains the value of 4, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 4. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is not equal to 0, then `dx` is updated to [4, 4, 1] if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1. Otherwise, `dx` is updated to [4, 4, 0].***
