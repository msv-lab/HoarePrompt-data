Example Answer:
The value of `seen[u]` is updated to `num`. The conditions for updating `num` are not provided, so `num` remains the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: If `pu` is equal to `goal`, the states remain the same. If `pu` is not equal to `goal`, then `num` is updated to `pnum + vv`. Additionally, either `x` is less than 0, `y` is less than 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `h`, `y` is greater than or equal to `w`, or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'. Finally, if `(seen[u] is None or seen[u] > num)` is true, then the postcondition is satisfied.
