Example Answer:
The value of `num` is assigned to `seen[u]`. However, since the conditions for changing the value of `num` are not met, the value of `num` remains the same. Therefore, there is no change in the values of `num`, `pnum`, or `vv`. 
Output State: **No change in the values of `num`, `pnum`, or `vv**
