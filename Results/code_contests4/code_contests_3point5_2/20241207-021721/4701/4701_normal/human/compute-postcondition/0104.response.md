According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is 4, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within the range of -2 to 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 4.
State: **`j` is within the range of -2 to 2, `dy` contains [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, j], `vvs` contains values based on the condition in the loop with an additional value of 1 if abs(i) + abs(j) > 1, `dx` contains the value of 4, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 4**
