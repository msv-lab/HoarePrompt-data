Output State: **`num` is assigned the result of `pnum + vv`, `x` and `y` are updated integers, `h` and `w` are integers, `ss` is a 2D list of characters, `seen[u]` is now equal to `num` if `seen[u]` is None or greater than `num`. The program continues without any changes to the variables if x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= h or y >= w or `ss[x][y]` is equal to '#'.**
