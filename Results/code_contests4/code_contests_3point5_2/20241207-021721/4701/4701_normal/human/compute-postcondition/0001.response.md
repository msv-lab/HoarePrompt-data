Example Answer:
The recursion limit of the system is set to the maximum value between 1000 and 10^9. Since the initial state does not specify the current recursion limit, the new recursion limit will be set to the higher value of 1000 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` lambda function is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9.
Output State: **`input` lambda function is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, recursion limit is set to the higher value between 1000 and 10^9.**
