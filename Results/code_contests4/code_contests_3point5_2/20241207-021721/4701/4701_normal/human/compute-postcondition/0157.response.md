Example Answer:
`num` is assigned the value of `pnum + vv`. The values of `pnum` and `vv` are known from the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `num` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **If `pu` is equal to `goal`, the states remain the same. Otherwise, if `pu` is not equal to `goal`, `num` is updated to `pnum + vv`.**
