The function `func` reads input values, performs a calculation, and then prints the result rounded up to the nearest integer. However, the annotation mentions divisibility cases related to `n`, `x`, and `y`, which are not implemented in the code. The actual functionality of the code is to take input values, perform a specific calculation, and print the rounded result.
