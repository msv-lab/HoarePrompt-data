The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function's output is as follows:
- Case 1: If `n` is divisible by both `x` and `y`, the function returns "Both".
- Case 2: If `n` is divisible by only `x` and not by `y`, the function returns "Only X".
- Case 3: If `n` is divisible by only `y` and not by `x`, the function returns "Only Y".
- Case 4: If `n` is not divisible by either `x` or `y`, the function returns "Neither".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the divisibility of `n` by `x` and `y`, and return the corresponding result based on the provided constraints.
