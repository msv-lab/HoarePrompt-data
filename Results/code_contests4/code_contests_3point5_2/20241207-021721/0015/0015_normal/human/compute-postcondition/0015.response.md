Postcondition: ***Error: raw_input() is not a valid function in Python 3, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, `num` is a list containing the integer values appended through the loop, for the loop to execute `p` must still have elements to iterate over. If `y` is an integer and divisible by 1, the program continues as described. Otherwise, if `y` is not an integer, the program continues as described.***
