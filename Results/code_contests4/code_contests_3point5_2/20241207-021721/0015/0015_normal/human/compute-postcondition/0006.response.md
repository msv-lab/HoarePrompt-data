Example Answer:
`num` appends the integer value of `i` to the list. The function `raw_input()` is not valid in Python 3, so an error will occur. Therefore, the output state is: Error: raw_input() is not a valid function in Python 3, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, `num` is a list containing the integer values appended through the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `p` must still have elements to iterate over.
Output State: **Error: raw_input() is not a valid function in Python 3, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, `num` is a list containing the integer values appended through the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `p` must still have elements to iterate over**
