Example Answer:
The variable `c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. However, `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, so this code will raise an error. The other variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unaffected.
Output State: **Error: raw_input() is not a valid function in Python 3, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged**
