Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly reads the input values, performs the calculation to find the minimum number of clones needed, and then prints the result rounded up to the nearest integer. The calculation is done according to the problem description, ensuring that the demonstration involves no less than y percent of the total city population. The code handles cases where the number of clones needed may be a decimal value by rounding up to the nearest integer, as required. The code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
