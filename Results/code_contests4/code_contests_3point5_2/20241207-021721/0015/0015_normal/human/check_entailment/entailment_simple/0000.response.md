Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses the `raw_input()` function, which is not a valid function in Python 3. Additionally, the program does not read input as described in the problem statement. The program should take input from the user in the format specified in the problem description, but it doesn't. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct output.
