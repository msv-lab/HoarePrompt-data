Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. It is supposed to calculate the minimum number of clones needed for the demonstration to have no less than y percent of the total city population, but the calculation in the program does not match this requirement. Additionally, the use of `raw_input()` is not valid in Python 3, which will cause an error when running the program.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is not correct.
