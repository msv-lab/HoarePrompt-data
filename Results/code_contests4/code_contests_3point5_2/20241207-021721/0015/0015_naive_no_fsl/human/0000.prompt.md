You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Some country is populated by wizards. They want to organize a demonstration.

There are n people living in the city, x of them are the wizards who will surely go to the demonstration. Other city people (n - x people) do not support the wizards and aren't going to go to the demonstration. We know that the city administration will react only to the demonstration involving at least y percent of the city people. Having considered the matter, the wizards decided to create clone puppets which can substitute the city people on the demonstration. 

So all in all, the demonstration will involve only the wizards and their puppets. The city administration cannot tell the difference between a puppet and a person, so, as they calculate the percentage, the administration will consider the city to be consisting of only n people and not containing any clone puppets. 

Help the wizards and find the minimum number of clones to create to that the demonstration had no less than y percent of the city people.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers, n, x, y (1 ≤ n, x, y ≤ 104, x ≤ n) — the number of citizens in the city, the number of wizards and the percentage the administration needs, correspondingly.

Please note that y can exceed 100 percent, that is, the administration wants to see on a demonstration more people that actually live in the city ( > n).

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem, the minimum number of clones to create, so that the demonstration involved no less than y percent of n (the real total city population). 

Examples

1000 352 146


Output

1108

Note

In the first sample it is necessary that at least 14% of 10 people came to the demonstration. As the number of people should be integer, then at least two people should come. There is only one wizard living in the city and he is going to come. That isn't enough, so he needs to create one clone. 

In the second sample 10 people should come to the demonstration. The city has 10 wizards. They will all come to the demonstration, so nobody has to create any clones.
Program:
```
c = raw_input()
p = c.split()
num = []
for i in p:
    num.append(int(i))
y = float(num[0] * num[2]) / float(100) - num[1]
if y % 1 == 0:
    print(int(y))
else:
    print(int(y) + 1)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
