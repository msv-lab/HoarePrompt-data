Correctness: False

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the calculated number of clones is negative. This can happen if the number of wizards is already greater than the required percentage of the total population. For example, in the input "10 5 70", the program would output -3, which is incorrect. The program should include a check to ensure that the calculated number of clones is not negative.
