Example Answer:
`B` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. The previous values of `B` are unknown, so after execution, the value of `B` will be the list with one element containing the value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N-1 empty elements and one element containing the value of `a`, B is a list with one element containing the value of `b`.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N-1 empty elements and one element containing the value of `a`, B is a list with one element containing the value of `b`**
