Postcondition: ***N, H, a_i, b_i, A, B, am, h need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. If b < am, c is increased by the value of ceil((H - h) * 1.0 / am) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b >= am, h is increased by the value of b, c is increased by 1, and bi is increased by 1.***
