Output State: **N, H, a_i, b_i, A, B, am, h, c, bi are positive integers. A contains N elements, B contains N+1 elements. am is the maximum value in list A. B is reversed. h is less than H. b is assigned the last element of list B. b is less than am. c is incremented by the ceiling value of ((H - h) / am). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
