Example Answer:
The value of variable `a` is appended to list A. The value of `a` is obtained from the input split by space. There is no direct impact on other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N-1 empty elements and one element containing the value of `a`, B is a list with N empty elements, a and b are assigned values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by space.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N-1 empty elements and one element containing the value of `a`, B is a list with N empty elements, a and b are assigned values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by space.**
