Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by the integer division of `(H - h) / am` rounded up using `ceil()`. The values of `H`, `h`, and `am` are known, but the initial value of `c` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: N, H, a_i, b_i, A, B, am, h needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time; c is incremented based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **N, H, a_i, b_i, A, B, am, h needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time; c is incremented based on the mentioned calculation**
