The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the parameter constraints provided. The function returns the result based on the constraints where N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
