Example Answer:
`A` is appended with the value `a`, and `a` is a positive integer. `N` is incremented by 1 to satisfy the loop condition. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N empty elements and one element containing the value of `a`, B is a list with one element containing the value of `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than N+1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N empty elements and one element containing the value of `a`, B is a list with one element containing the value of `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than N+1**
