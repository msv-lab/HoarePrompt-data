According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `h` and `H`. If `h` is less than `H`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- If b < am: 
    - Increment c based on the mentioned calculation
    - Break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- If b is larger or equal to am:
    - N, H, a_i, b_i + 1, A, B, am, h, c

State: **N, H, a_i, b_i, A, B, am, h need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time**
