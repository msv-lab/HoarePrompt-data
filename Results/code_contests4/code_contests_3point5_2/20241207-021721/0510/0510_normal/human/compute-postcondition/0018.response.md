Example Answer:
The list B is reversed, meaning its order is reversed. If B was [3, 6, 9], after reversal, it becomes [9, 6, 3]. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N elements containing the values of `a` for each iteration of the loop, B is a list with N elements containing the sorted values of `b`, `am` is the maximum value in list A, B is now reversed.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N elements containing the values of `a` for each iteration of the loop, B is a list with N elements containing the sorted values of `b`, `am` is the maximum value in list A, B is now reversed**
