According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `N+1`.
State: **N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is a list with N-1 empty elements and one element containing the value of `a`, B is a list with one element containing the value of `b`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than N+1**
