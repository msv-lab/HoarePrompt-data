Example Answer:
The list `A` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `N` and `H` are assigned values based on the input from `raw_input().split()`. The values of `N` and `H` are not directly specified, but it is known that they are positive integers. The variables `a_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is an empty list.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, H is a positive integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, A is an empty list**
