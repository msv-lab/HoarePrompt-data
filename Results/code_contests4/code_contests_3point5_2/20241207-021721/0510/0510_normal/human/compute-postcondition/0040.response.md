Postcondition: ***N, H, a_i, b_i, A, B, am, h need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. If b < am, c is incremented based on the mentioned calculation and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b is larger or equal to am, N, H, a_i, b_i + 1, A, B, am, h, c are adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.***
