Postcondition: ***N, H, a_i, b_i, A, B, am, h, c, bi are positive integers. A contains N elements, B contains N+1 elements. am is the maximum value in list A. B is reversed. h is less than H. b is assigned the last element of list B. If b < am, c is incremented by the ceiling value of ((H - h) / am) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If b >= am, c is 1 and bi is incremented by 1.***
