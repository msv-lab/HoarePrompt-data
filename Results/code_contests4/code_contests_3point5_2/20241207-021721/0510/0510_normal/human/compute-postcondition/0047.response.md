Example Answer: 
`bi` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `bi` is unknown, so after execution, `bi` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `h` is increased by the value of `b`, `c` is increased by 1, `bi` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `h` is increased by the value of `b`, `c` is increased by 1, `bi` is increased by 1**
