The function `func` reads input values N and H, then reads N pairs of integers into lists A and B. It calculates the maximum value in A and sorts B in descending order. It iterates through the elements of B, adding them to variable h until h is greater than or equal to H. It keeps track of the number of iterations in c and prints the final value of c. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the provided constraints.
