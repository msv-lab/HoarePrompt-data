Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values N and H, then reads N pairs of integers into lists A and B. It calculates the maximum value in A and sorts B in descending order. It iterates through the elements of B, adding them to variable h until h is greater than or equal to H. It keeps track of the number of iterations in c and prints the final value of c. The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
