Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the total number of attacks needed to vanquish the monster based on the damage values of the swords and the monster's health. The program iterates through the swords, choosing the most damaging one each time until the monster's health is depleted. The final output is the minimum total number of attacks required to defeat the monster.

The program handles all possible cases and scenarios as described in the problem description, making it correct.
