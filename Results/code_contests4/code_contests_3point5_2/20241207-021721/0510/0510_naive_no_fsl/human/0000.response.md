Correctness: False

The provided program does not handle the case where throwing a katana is more efficient than wielding the katana with the highest damage. In the scenario where throwing a katana can help in reducing the total number of attacks required to vanish the monster, the program will not give the correct output.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 10
5 7
6 8
```

The correct output should be 2 (throwing katana 2 and then wielding katana 1), but the program will output 3.
