Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total number of attacks required to vanish the monster for all potential cases. The issue lies in the calculation of the minimum number of attacks needed.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 10
3 5
2 6
```

The expected output should be 2, as the monster can be defeated with just two attacks. However, the provided program may not give the correct output for this case due to the incorrect calculation of the minimum number of attacks required.
