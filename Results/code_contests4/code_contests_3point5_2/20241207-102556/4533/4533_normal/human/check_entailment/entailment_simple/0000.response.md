Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. It iterates through the list of floors in reverse order, keeping track of the maximum number of floors seen so far. For each house, it calculates the difference between the maximum number of floors and the current house's number of floors, adding 1 to account for the current house itself. If this value is negative, it sets it to 0. Then it updates the maximum number of floors seen so far to be the maximum of the current house's number of floors and the previous maximum.

The program then prints the list of calculated values for each house in the correct order, separated by spaces. This matches the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
