Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious based on a formula that depends on the maximum value encountered in the list of floors. However, the code does not consider the condition that a house is considered luxurious if the number of floors in it is strictly greater than in all the houses with larger numbers. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
3 2 1 4
```
The expected output is:
```
2 3 4 0
```
However, the code will output:
```
2 0 4 0
```
This is because the code does not take into account the comparison with all the houses to the right from the current house to determine if it should be considered luxurious. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
