Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.next())`, where `sys.stdin.next()` reads the input from the standard input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
