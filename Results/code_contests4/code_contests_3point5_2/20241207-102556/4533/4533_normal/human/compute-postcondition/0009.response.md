Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`. The value of `h` is the element before the last element in the `floors` list. Therefore, `m` will be updated accordingly. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is the updated maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is a list containing the newly appended string, `floors` is not empty, `h` is the element before the last element in the `floors` list, `s` is a list of elements processed in reverse order, the newly calculated value based on the formula is appended to the `s` list.**
