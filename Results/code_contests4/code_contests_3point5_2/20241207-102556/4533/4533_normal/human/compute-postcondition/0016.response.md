Functionality: **The function reads an integer input `n` from the standard input, then reads a list of integers `floors`, calculates specific values based on the elements in `floors` in reverse order, and prints the result. The calculated values are based on a formula that depends on the maximum value encountered in `floors`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
