Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to the maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`. The value of `h` is unknown, but `m` is already updated to the maximum value. The list `s` contains the newly appended string with the calculated value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is the updated maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is a list containing the newly appended string with the calculated value.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is the updated maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is a list containing the newly appended string with the calculated value**
