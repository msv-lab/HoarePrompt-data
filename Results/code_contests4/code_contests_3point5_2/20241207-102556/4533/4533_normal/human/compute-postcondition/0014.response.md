Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the elements of list `s` in reverse order with a space between each element. The `join` function joins the elements of `s` using a space as a separator. The `strip` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is the maximum value between all elements in `floors`, `s` is a list containing the calculated values based on the formula for each element in `floors` in reverse order and the elements are printed with spaces in between.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is the maximum value between all elements in `floors`, `s` is a list containing the calculated values based on the formula for each element in `floors` in reverse order and the elements are printed with spaces in between.**
