According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `floors`. If the `floors` list is not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 0 and `s` is a list of elements processed in reverse order. So for the loop to be executed, `floors` is not empty, `h` is the last element in the `floors` list, `m` is 0, and `s` is a list of elements processed in reverse order.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `s` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `floors` is not empty, `h` is the last element in the `floors` list, `s` is a list of elements processed in reverse order**
