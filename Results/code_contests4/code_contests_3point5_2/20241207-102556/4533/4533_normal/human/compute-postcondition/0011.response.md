Example Answer: 
The value of `m - h + 1` is calculated and appended to the `s` list after being converted to a string with the format specifier `%i`. If the result of `m - h + 1` is greater than 0, it is appended, otherwise, 0 is appended. The previous values of `m`, `h`, and `s` are used in this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is the updated maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is a list containing the newly appended string with the calculated value.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is the updated maximum value between `h` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is a list containing the newly appended string with the calculated value**
