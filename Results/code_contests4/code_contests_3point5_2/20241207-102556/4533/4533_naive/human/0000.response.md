Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the number of floors that need to be added to each house to make it luxurious. It iterates through the list of house floors in reverse order, keeping track of the maximum number of floors seen so far. For each house, it calculates the difference between the maximum number of floors and the current house's floors, adding 1 to account for the current floor. If the calculated value is less than or equal to 0, it sets the value to 0. Finally, it reverses the list of calculated values and outputs them. This logic covers all potential cases and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
