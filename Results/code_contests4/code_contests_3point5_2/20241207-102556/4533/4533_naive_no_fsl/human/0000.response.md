Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of houses and the number of floors in each house. It then iterates over the list of floors in reverse order, calculating the number of floors needed to add to make the house luxurious. The program correctly follows the problem description and outputs the correct result for each house. The logic used to calculate the number of floors needed is also accurate. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
