The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` from input and a list `a` consisting of 2n integers where each integer represents the size of a tier and is between 1 and n (inclusive), with each number from 1 to n occurring exactly twice in the list. The function then calculates the total distance `dist` by summing the absolute differences between consecutive indices of the sorted list `a`. Finally, it prints the total distance `dist`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates within the constraints specified.
