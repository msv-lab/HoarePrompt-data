Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. 

- Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is not directly related to the problem description but is correctly implemented.
- Function 2 takes the input for the number of tiers `n` and the sizes of the tiers in each house. It then calculates the minimum distance Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy both cakes by iterating over the sorted list of tuples containing the tier sizes and their corresponding indices. The program calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive indices for both Sasha and Dima, ensuring that they buy tiers in ascending order of size. The final distance is correctly calculated and printed.

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum distance Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy both cakes, the correctness is true.
