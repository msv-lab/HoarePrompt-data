You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sasha and Dima want to buy two n-tier cakes. Each cake should consist of n different tiers: from the size of 1 to the size of n. Tiers should go in order from the smallest to the biggest (from top to bottom).

They live on the same street, there are 2 ⋅ n houses in a row from left to right. Each house has a pastry shop where you can buy a cake tier. Unfortunately, in each pastry shop you can buy only one tier of only one specific size: in the i-th house you can buy a tier of the size a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).

Since the guys carry already purchased tiers, and it is impossible to insert a new tier in the middle of the cake, they agreed to buy tiers from the smallest to the biggest. That is, each of them buys tiers in order: 1, then 2, then 3 and so on up to n.

Initially, Sasha and Dima are located near the first (leftmost) house. Output the minimum distance that they will have to walk in total to buy both cakes. The distance between any two neighboring houses is exactly 1.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer number n — the number of tiers in each cake (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains 2 ⋅ n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where a_i is equal to the size of the tier, which can be bought in the i-th house. Remember that in each house you can buy only one tier. It is guaranteed that every number from 1 to n occurs in a exactly two times.

Output

Print one number — the minimum distance that the guys have to walk in total to buy both cakes. Guys can be near same house at the same time. They begin near the first (leftmost) house. Each of the guys should buy n tiers in ascending order of their sizes.

Examples

Note

In the first example, the possible optimal sequence of actions is:

  * Sasha buys a tier of size 1 near the 1-st house (a_1=1); 
  * Dima goes to the house 2; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 1 near the 2-nd house (a_2=1); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 4; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 2 near the 4-th house (a_4=2); 
  * Sasha goes to the house 5; 
  * Sasha buys a tier of size 3 near the 5-th house (a_5=3); 
  * Dima goes to the house 3; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 2 near the 3-rd house (a_3=2); 
  * Dima goes to the house 6; 
  * Dima buys a tier of size 3 near the 6-th house (a_6=3). 



So, Sasha goes the distance 3+1=4, and Dima goes the distance 1+1+3=5. In total, they cover a distance of 4+5=9. You can make sure that with any other sequence of actions they will walk no less distance.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer. a_i is an integer representing the size of the tier in the i-th house, and it follows the constraints 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the list of a_i's.**
def func_1(x, y):
    """greatest common divisor of x and y"""
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` and `y` are updated based on their previous values until `y` becomes 0, at that point `x` holds the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y` when `y` becomes 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The list a contains 2n integers where each integer represents the size of a tier and is between 1 and n (inclusive). Each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the list a.**
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    a = sorted(zip(map(int, input().split()), range(1, 2 * n + 1)))
    dist = 0
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i][1]
        
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        
        prev = pos
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of a tier and its corresponding index, each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive index values in the tuples in list `a`, `prev` is equal to the index value from the last tuple in list `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`
    prev = 1
    for i in range(n):
        pos = a[2 * i + 1][1]
        
        dist += abs(pos - prev)
        
        prev = pos
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive index values in the tuples in list `a`, `prev` is the index value from the last tuple in list `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`
    print(dist)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
