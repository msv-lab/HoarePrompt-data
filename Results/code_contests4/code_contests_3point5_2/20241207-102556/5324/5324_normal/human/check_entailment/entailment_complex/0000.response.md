Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code reads the input correctly by taking the number of tiers `n` and the sizes of the tiers in each house.
2. The function `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima have to walk to buy both cakes.
3. The function `func_2` iterates through the list of tiers and calculates the distances they have to walk based on the order of purchasing the tiers, which aligns with the problem description.
4. The code handles the case where each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the list of tier sizes, ensuring that each tier can be purchased by Sasha and Dima.
5. The output of the code corresponds to the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima have to walk, as required by the problem description.
6. Overall, the code functions correctly and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
