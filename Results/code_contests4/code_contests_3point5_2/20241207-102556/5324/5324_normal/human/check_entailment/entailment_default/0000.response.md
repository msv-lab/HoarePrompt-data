Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from input and a list `a` consisting of 2n integers where each integer represents the size of a tier and is between 1 and n (inclusive), with each number from 1 to n occurring exactly twice in the list.
- It then calculates the total distance `dist` by summing the absolute differences between consecutive indices of the sorted list `a`.
- Finally, it prints the total distance `dist`.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it correctly calculates the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk to buy both cakes. 
- The output hints accurately describe the behavior of the code and do not provide any contradictory information. 
- Therefore, based on the code functionality and output hints, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
