The function func_1 accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` and calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`. It achieves this by continuously updating `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0. The function then returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `x` and `y`.
