The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function is designed to work with the predefined constraints provided in the parameter constraints. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it is expected to perform some operations based on the constraints defined in the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It works with the predefined constraints where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The list a contains 2n integers where each integer represents the size of a tier and is between 1 and n (inclusive). Each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the list a.**
