Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of a tier and its corresponding index, each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, `dist` is the updated value after the calculation, `prev` is now equal to the index value from the tuple at the 2 * (i + 1) position in list `a`, `n` is greater than (i + 1), `pos` is now equal to the index value from the tuple at the 2 * i position in list `a`**
