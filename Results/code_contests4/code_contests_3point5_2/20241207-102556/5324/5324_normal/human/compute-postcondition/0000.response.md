Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `a` is not initialized or affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The list a contains 2n integers where each integer represents the size of a tier and is between 1 and n (inclusive). Each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the list a.**.
