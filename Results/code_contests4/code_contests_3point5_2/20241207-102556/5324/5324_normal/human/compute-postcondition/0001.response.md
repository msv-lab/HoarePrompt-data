Example Answer:
The code snippet sorts the list `a` based on the first element of each tuple. The `zip` function combines the elements of the two lists: the result of mapping each element of the input split by space to an integer and the range from 1 to 2n + 1. The output list `a` will have tuples where the first element is the size of a tier and the second element is the corresponding index. Since the list contains 2n elements, each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the list.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of a tier and its corresponding index. Each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in the list.**
