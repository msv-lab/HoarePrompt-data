Example Answer: 
The distance `dist` is increased by the absolute difference between the current position `pos` and the previous position `prev`. The initial values of `dist` and `prev` are 0 and 1 respectively. Since `pos` is the index value from the tuple at the 2 * i position in list `a`, the calculation `abs(pos - prev)` can be performed based on the specific values of `pos` and `prev` in `a`. 
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of a tier and its corresponding index, each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, `dist` is the updated value after the calculation, `prev` remains 1, `n` is greater than 0, `pos` is the index value from the tuple at the 2 * i position in list `a`.**
