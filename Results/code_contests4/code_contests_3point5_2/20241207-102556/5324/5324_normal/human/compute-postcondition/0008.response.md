According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` has been updated, `prev` is now equal to the index value from the tuple at the 2 * i position in list `a`, and `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of a tier and its corresponding index, each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, `dist` is the updated value after the calculation, `prev` is now equal to the index value from the tuple at the 2 * (i + 1) position in list `a`, `n` is greater than (i + 1)**
