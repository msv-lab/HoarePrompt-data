According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, as long as `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the list `a` being sorted and containing each number from 1 to n exactly twice indicates that the loop can execute. The variables `dist` being 0 and `prev` being 1 do not directly impact the loop execution but might need to be adjusted based on the loop body.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of a tier and its corresponding index, each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, `dist` is 0, `prev` is 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
