According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is calculated based on the differences, `prev` is now equal to `pos`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`, `i` is 0, and `pos` is the index value from the tuple at position `2 * i + 1` in list `a`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences, `prev` is now equal to `pos`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `pos` is the index value from the tuple at position `2 * i + 1` in list `a`**
