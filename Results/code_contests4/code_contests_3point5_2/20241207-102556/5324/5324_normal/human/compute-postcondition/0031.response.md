Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `dist`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive index values in the tuples in list `a`. The value of `dist` is already calculated and stored in the variable `dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive index values in the tuples in list `a`, `prev` is the index value from the last tuple in list `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive index values in the tuples in list `a`, `prev` is the index value from the last tuple in list `a`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`**
