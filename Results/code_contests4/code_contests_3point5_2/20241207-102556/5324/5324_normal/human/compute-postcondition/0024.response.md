Example Answer:
The absolute difference between `pos` and `prev` is calculated and added to the `dist`. The values of `dist`, `prev`, `n`, `i`, and `pos` are not given, so the output state is: `a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is updated with the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, `prev` is now equal to `pos`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `pos` is the index value from the tuple at position `2 * i + 1` in list `a.
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples, `dist` is updated with the absolute difference between `pos` and `prev`, `prev` is now equal to `pos`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `pos` is the index value from the tuple at position `2 * i + 1` in list `a**
