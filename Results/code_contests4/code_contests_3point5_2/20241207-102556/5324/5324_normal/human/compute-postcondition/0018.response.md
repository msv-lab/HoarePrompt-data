According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a` ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`a` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the size of a tier and its corresponding index, each number from 1 to n occurs exactly twice, `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive index values in the tuples in list `a`, `prev` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of list `a`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
