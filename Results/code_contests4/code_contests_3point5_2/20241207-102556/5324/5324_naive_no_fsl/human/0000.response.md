Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum distance that Sasha and Dima will have to walk to buy both cakes. The program reads the input, sorts the tiers based on their size and house number, calculates the distance for Sasha and Dima separately, and then prints the total distance.

The program handles all potential cases and correctly calculates the minimum distance required for Sasha and Dima to buy the tiers in ascending order. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
