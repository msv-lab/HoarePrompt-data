Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description. It fails to handle the case where it is not possible to select an interval with the prescribed counts of lightsaber colors. The code does not output -1 in such cases, which is a requirement as per the problem description. Additionally, there are potential issues with the logic of the code when it comes to finding the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed. The output hints do not accurately describe all the cases covered by the code. The code may need modifications to ensure it meets all the requirements of the problem description.
