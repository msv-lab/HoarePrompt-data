Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed from the sequence so that there is an interval with the prescribed counts of lightsaber colors. The program uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the interval. It also maintains a count of each color of lightsabers in the interval and compares it with the desired counts.

The program handles all possible cases where it is not possible to select an interval with the desired counts of lightsaber colors by returning -1. Additionally, it correctly calculates the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.
