Example Answer:
The value at index `a[r]` in list `b` is incremented by 1 and stored in list `c`. The index value `a[r]` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of integers in list `b`, `c` is a list of `m` elements with some elements incremented by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `ans` is -1, `t` is equal to `m - 1.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of integers in list `b`, `c` is a list of `m` elements with some elements incremented by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `ans` is -1, `t` is equal to `m - 1**
