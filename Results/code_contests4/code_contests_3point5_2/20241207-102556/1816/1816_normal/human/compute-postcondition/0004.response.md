Example Answer:
A list `c` is created with `m` elements, each initialized to 0. The value of `m` is a positive integer, so `c` will have `m` elements all set to 0. The other variables `n`, `b`, and `s` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of integers in list `b`, `c` is a list of `m` elements initialized to 0**
