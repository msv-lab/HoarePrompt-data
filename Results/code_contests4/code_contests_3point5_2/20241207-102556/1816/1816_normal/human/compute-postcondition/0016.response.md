Example Answer:
The value at index `a[r]` in the list `c` is incremented by 1. The variables `m`, `b`, `s`, `c`, `l`, `r` are increased by 1, while `ans` and `t` remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` needs to be such that `r + 1 < n` to execute the loop again, `m`, `b`, `s`, `c`, `l`, `r` is increased by 1, `ans`, `t` remain the same**
