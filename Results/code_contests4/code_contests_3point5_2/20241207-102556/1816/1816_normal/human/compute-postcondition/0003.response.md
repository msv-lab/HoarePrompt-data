Example Answer:
The sum of the integers in list `b` is calculated and assigned to variable `s`. The initial state variables `n`, `m`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of integers in list `b`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of integers in list `b`**
