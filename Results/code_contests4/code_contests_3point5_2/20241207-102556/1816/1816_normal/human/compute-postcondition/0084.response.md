Functionality: **The function accepts input for the number of lightsabers and the desired counts of Jedi Knights with lightsabers of each color. It then checks if the list of colors of lightsabers can satisfy the desired counts. If it can, the function calculates and prints the minimum number of lightsabers that need to be bought to satisfy all counts. If the conditions are not met, it prints the last valid solution before breaking the loop.**
