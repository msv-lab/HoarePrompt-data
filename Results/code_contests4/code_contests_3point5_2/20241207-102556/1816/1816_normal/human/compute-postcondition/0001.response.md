Example Answer:
The code snippet `a = map(lambda x: int(x) - 1, raw_input().split())` assigns the result of applying the lambda function to each element of the input split by spaces to variable `a`. In this case, `a` will contain the list of integers obtained by subtracting 1 from each element of the input. Since the initial state does not mention any input values for `raw_input().split()`, we cannot determine the exact values in `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n**
