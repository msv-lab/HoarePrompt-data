Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `b`, `s`, `l`, and `t` remain the same as their initial values, `c` contains the counts of elements in list `a` such that the count of each element matches the corresponding element in list `b`, `r` is incremented by 1, if `t` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `l` must be less than or equal to `r` and `r + 1` must not be less than `n`.**
