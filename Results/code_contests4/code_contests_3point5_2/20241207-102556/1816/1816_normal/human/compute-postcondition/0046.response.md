Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `b`, `s`, and `t` remain the same as their initial values, `c` contains the final counts of elements in list `a` such that the count of each element matches the corresponding element in list `b`, `r` is such that `r + 1` is not less than `n`, `l` is increased by 1. If `c[a[l]]` is less than `b[a[l]]`, the loop breaks, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `r - l + 1 - s`.**
