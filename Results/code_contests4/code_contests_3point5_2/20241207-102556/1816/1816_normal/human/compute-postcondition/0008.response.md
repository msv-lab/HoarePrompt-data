According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t` and `r`. If `t` is greater than 0 and `r + 1` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is equal to `m`, `r` is -1, and `n` is a positive integer. To allow the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `t` needs to be decremented by 1 to allow the loop to continue.
2. `r` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of integers in list `b`, `c` is a list of `m` elements initialized to 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `ans` is -1, `t` is equal to `m - 1`**
