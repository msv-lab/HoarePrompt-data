Example Answer:
The code snippet `b = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `b`. Since `n` and `m` are positive integers, there is no direct impact on them. 
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `b` is a list of integers**
