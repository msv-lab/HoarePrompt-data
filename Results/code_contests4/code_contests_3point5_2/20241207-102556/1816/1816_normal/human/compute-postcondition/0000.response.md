Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values by mapping integers extracted from the input split by spaces. The values of `n` and `m` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n**
