According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t` and `r`. If `t` is greater than 0 and `r + 1` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is equal to `m - 2`, `r` is 1, and `n` is not given. `n` is required to determine if `r + 1 < n`. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be such that `r + 1 < n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` needs to be such that `r + 1 < n` to execute the loop again, `m`, `b`, `s`, `c`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `t` remain the same.**
