Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It keeps track of the count of Jedi Knights with each color of lightsaber and checks if the desired counts are met in a contiguous interval. The program handles the case where it is not possible to select such an interval by removing a minimum number of Jedi Knights. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
