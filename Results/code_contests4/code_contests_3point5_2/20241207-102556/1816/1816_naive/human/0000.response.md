Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and processes them according to the problem description. It keeps track of the count of Jedi Knights with each color and iterates through the sequence to find the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed. The logic seems sound and accounts for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Since no case has been found where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
