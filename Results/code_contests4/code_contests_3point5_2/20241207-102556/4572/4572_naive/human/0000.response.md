Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum positive value of x such that the polyline passes through the point (a, b) as described in the problem. The program takes input values for a and b, checks if a is less than b, and if so, prints -1 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum positive value of x using the formula provided in the problem description and prints the result. The program uses floating-point arithmetic to ensure precision in the output. 

For all the given examples in the problem description, the program produces the correct output without any issues. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and examples, the program can be considered correct.
