Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem described. 

1. The program is not correctly reading the input. The problem description specifies that the input consists of two positive integers, but the program is trying to read two float values using `map(float, raw_input().split())`.

2. The condition `(a < b)` is used to check if `a` is less than `b` and if so, it prints -1 and exits. However, the problem description does not mention anything about comparing `a` and `b`, it just specifies the calculation needed to find the minimum positive value of x.

3. The calculation in the print statement `(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b)))` is not equivalent to the calculation needed to find the minimum positive value of x as described in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
