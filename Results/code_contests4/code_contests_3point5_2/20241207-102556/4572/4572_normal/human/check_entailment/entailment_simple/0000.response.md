Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. 

1. The program does not handle the case where there is no such x that satisfies the condition. The problem description specifies that in such cases, the program should output -1. However, the program just exits with a status code of 0 if a is less than b, without outputting -1.

2. The calculation of x in the program is incorrect. The formula used in the program to calculate x (`(a + b) / (2 * math.floor((a + b) / (2 * b))`) does not match the formula required to find the minimum positive value x that satisfies the condition described in the problem.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
