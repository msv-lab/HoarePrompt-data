Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are converted to float values using the `map` function and `float` conversion. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers, the values after conversion to float will have decimal points. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive float values.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive float values**
