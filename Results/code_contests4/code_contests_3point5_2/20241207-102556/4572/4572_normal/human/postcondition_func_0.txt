The function `func` reads two float values `a` and `b` from the user input. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints -1 and exits the program. Otherwise, it calculates (a + b) / (2 * floor((a + b) / (2 * b))) and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and operates with predefined positive float variables `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
