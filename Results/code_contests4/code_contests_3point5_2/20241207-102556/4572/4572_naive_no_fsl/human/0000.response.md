Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It calculates the minimum positive value of x such that the polyline passes through the point (a, b) or outputs -1 if no such x exists. The program checks if a < b first, as this condition indicates that there is no solution, and then calculates the value of x based on the given formula. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
