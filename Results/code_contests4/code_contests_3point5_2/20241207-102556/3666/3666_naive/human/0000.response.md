Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program reads the number of queries `q` and then reads `q` sets of four integers representing the segments. It then prints two integers `a` and `b` for each query such that `l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1`, `l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2`, and `a ≠ b`. The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It loops through each query, extracts the segment values, and prints two integers that satisfy the given conditions. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, it can be considered correct.
