Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input for the number of queries and then for each query, it takes input for the segments [l1, r1] and [l2, r2]. It then prints two integers a and b such that l1 ≤ a ≤ r1, l2 ≤ b ≤ r2, and a ≠ b. The output meets the requirements of the problem description and there are no edge cases or scenarios provided where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
