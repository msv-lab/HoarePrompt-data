The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. 
Case 1: If `a` is equal to 0, the function returns the values of 'b', 0, and 1.
Case 2: If `a` is not equal to 0, the function recursively calls itself with modified parameters and calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) along with values `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is calculated based on `y1`, `b`, and `x1`, while the value of `y` is assigned the value of `x1`.
