The function `func_12` recursively calculates values based on the input integer `n`. It returns different values depending on the conditions:

Case 1: If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns 0 and 1.
Case 2: If `n` is an odd number (not equal to 0), the function calculates a value 'c' based on the values of 'p[0]' and 'p[1]' and returns 'c' added to 2 times the value of 'd'.
Case 3: If `n` is an even number (not equal to 0), the function calculates the sum of 'c' and 'd', where 'c' is based on the values of 'p[0]' and 'p[1]', and 'd' is the result of p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1'].

The provided annotations explain the behavior of the function for different cases. However, the actual code implementation may differ from what the annotations describe, so it's crucial to rely on the code itself to understand the function's functionality.
