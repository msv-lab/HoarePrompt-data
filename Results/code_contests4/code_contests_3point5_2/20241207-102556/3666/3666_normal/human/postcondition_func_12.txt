The function `func_13` sets up the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters. The annotations mention handling multiple queries represented by four integers per query. However, based on the actual code provided, the function does not process or handle these queries as the code only sets up the input stream. Therefore, the functionality is limited to setting up the standard input stream and does not actually process any queries as described in the annotations.
