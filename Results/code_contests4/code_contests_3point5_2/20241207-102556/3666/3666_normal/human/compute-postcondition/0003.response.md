According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. If `args` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is a positive integer and `at_start` is True, which doesn't ensure that the loop will execute. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `args` should not be empty, and `x` should be the first element in `args`.
State: **`q` is a positive integer, `at_start` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `args` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `args`**
