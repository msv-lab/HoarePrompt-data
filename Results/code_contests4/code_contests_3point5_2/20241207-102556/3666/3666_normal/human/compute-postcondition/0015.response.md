Example Answer:
`sep` is written to the file. The values of `q`, `at_start`, `args`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: q is a positive integer, at_start is False, args is not empty, x is the next element in args for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **q is a positive integer, at_start is False, args is not empty, x is the next element in args for the loop to execute another time**
