Example Answer: 
`x` is written to the file using `file.write(str(x))`. The value of `x` is the first element in `args`. If `at_start` is True, then `x` is the first element in `args` and it is written to the file. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer, `at_start` is True for the first iteration, `args` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `args`.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `at_start` is True for the first iteration, `args` is not empty, `x` is the first element in `args`**
