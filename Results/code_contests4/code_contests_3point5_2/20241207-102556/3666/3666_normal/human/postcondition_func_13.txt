The function `func_14` accepts two integers `x` and `y`. It then executes a loop where the value of `res` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`. After the loop execution, the function returns the final value of `res`. The loop operates by multiplying `res` with `x` when `y` is odd, squaring `x`, and shifting `y` right by 1 until `y` becomes 0. The function ensures that `x` and `y` are integers and `y` is greater than or equal to 0 for proper execution.
