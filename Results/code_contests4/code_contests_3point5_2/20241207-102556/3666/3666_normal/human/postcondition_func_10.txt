The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, and False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If none of these conditions are met, the function checks for divisibility by numbers in the form of 6k Â± 1 up to the square root of `n` and returns False if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, otherwise it returns True.
