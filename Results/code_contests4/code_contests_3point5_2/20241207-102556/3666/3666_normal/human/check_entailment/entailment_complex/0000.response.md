Correctness: **True**

Explanation: Based on the provided code and annotations, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The functions handle input processing, mathematical calculations, and output formatting as expected. Additionally, the code annotations provide insights into the behavior of each function, and there are no apparent discrepancies between the code, annotations, and problem description. Since there are no identified cases where the program deviates from the problem requirements, the correctness is deemed as True.
