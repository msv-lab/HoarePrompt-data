You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two segments [l_1; r_1] and [l_2; r_2] on the x-axis. It is guaranteed that l_1 < r_1 and l_2 < r_2. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.

<image> The example of two segments on the x-axis.

Your problem is to find two integers a and b such that l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1, l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2 and a ≠ b. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment [l_1; r_1] and the second one belongs to the segment [l_2; r_2].

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

You have to answer q independent queries.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 500) — the number of queries.

Each of the next q lines contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} and r_{2_i} (1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}) — the ends of the segments in the i-th query.

Output

Print 2q integers. For the i-th query print two integers a_i and b_i — such numbers that l_{1_i} ≤ a_i ≤ r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} ≤ b_i ≤ r_{2_i} and a_i ≠ b_i. Queries are numbered in order of the input.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function func_1 does not accept any parameters and returns an integer obtained from user input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and returns the user input as a string. It accurately reflects the postconditions provided.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads user input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object with the modified elements.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function `func_4` reads an input string, splits it by spaces, and then converts each element into a string. It returns a map object with the converted elements. However, the function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during input reading or conversion.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function func_5() does not accept any parameters and returns a list that contains the result of calling the function func_3().
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit and stack size for threading, then starts a new thread with the `main` function as the target. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output. The function `func_6` acts as a setup function for multithreading operations.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    sum = 0
    while n > 0:
        sum += int(n % 10)
        n = int(n / 10)
    return sum
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function func_7 accepts an integer n and calculates the sum of all the digits of the original value of n. It achieves this by iterating through each digit of n, summing them up, and returning the total sum. If n is 0, the function will return 0 as the sum of digits.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a parameter x and returns 0 if x is 0; otherwise, it returns 1.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts two parameters x and y, calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y iteratively until y becomes 0, and returns the final value of x which is the greatest common divisor of the original x and y. The function effectively implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    (gcd, x1, y1) = func_10(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - b // a * x1
    y = x1
    return (gcd, x, y)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. 
Case 1: If `a` is equal to 0, the function returns the values of 'b', 0, and 1.
Case 2: If `a` is not equal to 0, the function recursively calls itself with modified parameters and calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) along with values `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is calculated based on `y1`, `b`, and `x1`, while the value of `y` is assigned the value of `x1`.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, and False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If none of these conditions are met, the function checks for divisibility by numbers in the form of 6k ± 1 up to the square root of `n` and returns False if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, otherwise it returns True.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    if n == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    p = func_12(n >> 1)
    c = p[0] * (2 * p[1] - p[0])
    d = p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]
    if n & 1:
        return c + 2 * d
    else:
        return c + d
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function `func_12` recursively calculates values based on the input integer `n`. It returns different values depending on the conditions:

Case 1: If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns 0 and 1.
Case 2: If `n` is an odd number (not equal to 0), the function calculates a value 'c' based on the values of 'p[0]' and 'p[1]' and returns 'c' added to 2 times the value of 'd'.
Case 3: If `n` is an even number (not equal to 0), the function calculates the sum of 'c' and 'd', where 'c' is based on the values of 'p[0]' and 'p[1]', and 'd' is the result of p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1'].

The provided annotations explain the behavior of the function for different cases. However, the actual code implementation may differ from what the annotations describe, so it's crucial to rely on the code itself to understand the function's functionality.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function `func_13` sets up the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters. The annotations mention handling multiple queries represented by four integers per query. However, based on the actual code provided, the function does not process or handle these queries as the code only sets up the input stream. Therefore, the functionality is limited to setting up the standard input stream and does not actually process any queries as described in the annotations.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    res = 1
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x
        x = x * x
        y >>= 1
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts two integers `x` and `y`. It then executes a loop where the value of `res` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`. After the loop execution, the function returns the final value of `res`. The loop operates by multiplying `res` with `x` when `y` is odd, squaring `x`, and shifting `y` right by 1 until `y` becomes 0. The function ensures that `x` and `y` are integers and `y` is greater than or equal to 0 for proper execution.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    q = func_1()
    for i in range(q):
        (l1, r1, l2, r2) = func_3()
        func_16(l1, r2)
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function func_15 does not accept any parameters and iterates `q` times, calling the function func_16 with arguments `l1` and `r2` obtained from func_3 in each iteration. The function does not explicitly return any value but the overall output state is such that it iterates `q` times and calls func_16 with specific arguments.
Function number 16 :

 Output decription for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over elements in `args` and prints them to the specified `file` stream, separated by `sep`.

The function is expected to output information based on the constraints provided for the query parameters.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
