Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It handles the input of q independent queries, where each query contains four integers representing the segments [l1, r1] and [l2, r2]. The code then prints two integers a and b for each query such that l1 ≤ a ≤ r1, l2 ≤ b ≤ r2, and a ≠ b. The code iterates over each query, ensuring that the conditions for selecting a and b are met, and prints the values accordingly. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not cover. Thus, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is **True**.
