Correctness: **True**

The annotated program contains functions that handle input processing, mathematical calculations, and printing output based on the problem description provided. Each function is clearly defined and follows the specifications outlined in the problem description. The main function `func_15()` correctly handles the input queries and calls `func_16()` to print the required output.

The program ensures that for each query, two distinct integers `a` and `b` are chosen such that `l_1 ≤ a ≤ r_1`, `l_2 ≤ b ≤ r_2`, and `a ≠ b`, as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output is formatted correctly as per the description.

Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for each query.
