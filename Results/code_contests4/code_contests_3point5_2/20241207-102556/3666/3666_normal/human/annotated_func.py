    #The program returns a map object created by applying the int function to each element of the input obtained from splitting the user input by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads user input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object with the modified elements.

It does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output. The function `func_6` acts as a setup function for multithreading operations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_7 accepts an integer n and calculates the sum of all the digits of the original value of n. It achieves this by iterating through each digit of n, summing them up, and returning the total sum. If n is 0, the function will return 0 as the sum of digits.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. 
Case 1: If `a` is equal to 0, the function returns the values of 'b', 0, and 1.
Case 2: If `a` is not equal to 0, the function recursively calls itself with modified parameters and calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) along with values `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is calculated based on `y1`, `b`, and `x1`, while the value of `y` is assigned the value of `x1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` and returns False if `n` is less than or equal to 1, True if `n` is less than or equal to 3, and False if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If none of these conditions are met, the function checks for divisibility by numbers in the form of 6k ± 1 up to the square root of `n` and returns False if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, otherwise it returns True.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` recursively calculates values based on the input integer `n`. It returns different values depending on the conditions:

Case 1: If `n` is equal to 0, the function returns 0 and 1.
Case 2: If `n` is an odd number (not equal to 0), the function calculates a value 'c' based on the values of 'p[0]' and 'p[1]' and returns 'c' added to 2 times the value of 'd'.
Case 3: If `n` is an even number (not equal to 0), the function calculates the sum of 'c' and 'd', where 'c' is based on the values of 'p[0]' and 'p[1]', and 'd' is the result of p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1'].

The provided annotations explain the behavior of the function for different cases. However, the actual code implementation may differ from what the annotations describe, so it's crucial to rely on the code itself to understand the function's functionality.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 500. Each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9 and l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**
def func_13():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` sets up the standard input to read from a file named 'input.txt'. It does not accept any parameters. The annotations mention handling multiple queries represented by four integers per query. However, based on the actual code provided, the function does not process or handle these queries as the code only sets up the input stream. Therefore, the functionality is limited to setting up the standard input stream and does not actually process any queries as described in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 500.
- l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} are integers such that 1 <= l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} <= 10^9.
- l_{1_i} < r_{1_i} and l_{2_i} < r_{2_i} for each query.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `res`, `x`, `y` are integers. If `y` is odd, `res` is multiplied by `x`, `y` is divided by 2, `x` is squared, and `y` is shifted right by 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than 1. After the execution of the code `x = x * x`, the value of `x` is squared. Now, `y` is shifted right by 1.
    return res
    #The program returns the final value of 'res' after the loop execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integers `x` and `y`. It then executes a loop where the value of `res` is updated based on the values of `x` and `y`. After the loop execution, the function returns the final value of `res`. The loop operates by multiplying `res` with `x` when `y` is odd, squaring `x`, and shifting `y` right by 1 until `y` becomes 0. The function ensures that `x` and `y` are integers and `y` is greater than or equal to 0 for proper execution.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: The function `func_16` is called with arguments `l1` and `r2` for each iteration of the loop, where `l1` and `r2` are the values returned by `func_3()`. The loop will execute `q` times in total, assuming `q` is a non-negative integer returned by `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_15 does not accept any parameters and iterates `q` times, calling the function func_16 with arguments `l1` and `r2` obtained from func_3 in each iteration. The function does not explicitly return any value but the overall output state is such that it iterates `q` times and calls func_16 with specific arguments.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer. Each query contains four integers l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} such that 1 ≤ l_{1_i}, r_{1_i}, l_{2_i}, r_{2_i} ≤ 10^9, l_{1_i} < r_{1_i}, l_{2_i} < r_{2_i}.**

If 'flush' key in kwargs is popped with a value of False, then the program retains the same state as before the execution of the if statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over elements in `args` and prints them to the specified `file` stream, separated by `sep`. If no `sep` is provided, it defaults to a space. It then writes the value of the `end` key in `kwargs` to the file. If the `flush` key in `kwargs` is True, it flushes the stream. The function is expected to output information based on the constraints provided for the query parameters.
