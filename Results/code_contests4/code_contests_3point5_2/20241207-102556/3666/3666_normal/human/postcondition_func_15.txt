The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over elements in `args` and prints them to the specified `file` stream, separated by `sep`. If no `sep` is provided, it defaults to a space. It then writes the value of the `end` key in `kwargs` to the file. If the `flush` key in `kwargs` is True, it flushes the stream. The function is expected to output information based on the constraints provided for the query parameters.
