The function func_15 does not accept any parameters and iterates `q` times, calling the function func_16 with arguments `l1` and `r2` obtained from func_3 in each iteration. The function does not explicitly return any value but the overall output state is such that it iterates `q` times and calls func_16 with specific arguments.
