Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in four positive integers representing the pairwise sums and sum of three numbers, sorts them, and then calculates the original three numbers a, b, and c by subtracting the respective values. Since the program correctly calculates the original three numbers a, b, and c based on the input, it covers all potential cases and fulfills the problem description.
