Example Answer: 
The code prints the differences between the maximum value in the sorted list `numbers` and the other values in the list. The values in the list are sorted, so `numbers[3]` represents the maximum value, and `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, and `numbers[2]` represent the other values in ascending order. Therefore, the code calculates and prints the differences between the maximum value and the other values in the list. 
Output State: **x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each i in {1, 2, 3, 4}; numbers is a list containing the sorted input values as integers and the code prints the differences between the maximum value in the list and the other values.**
