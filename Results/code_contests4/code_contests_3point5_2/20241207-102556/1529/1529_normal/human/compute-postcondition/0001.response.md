Example Answer:
The `numbers` list is sorted in ascending order. Since the initial state mentions that the values in the list are positive integers, sorting them would rearrange the numbers in increasing order. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each i in {1, 2, 3, 4}; numbers is a list containing the sorted input values as integers.
Output State: **x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each i in {1, 2, 3, 4}; numbers is a list containing the sorted input values as integers**
