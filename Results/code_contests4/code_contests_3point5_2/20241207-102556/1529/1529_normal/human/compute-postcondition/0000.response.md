Example Answer:
The list `numbers` is created by converting the input values to integers. The values of x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 can be any positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each i in {1, 2, 3, 4}; numbers is a list containing the input values as integers.
Output State: **x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 are positive integers such that 2 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each i in {1, 2, 3, 4}; numbers is a list containing the input values as integers**
