Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes four numbers as input, sorts them, and then calculates the values of a, b, and c based on the sorted numbers. It then prints these values in any order. This follows the problem description as it guesses the three positive integers a, b, and c based on the given numbers a+b, a+c, b+c, and a+b+c. The program always produces the correct output as it calculates the values of a, b, and c based on the sorted input numbers.
