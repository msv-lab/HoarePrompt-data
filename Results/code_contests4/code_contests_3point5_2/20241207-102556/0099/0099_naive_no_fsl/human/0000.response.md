Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to pick k lamps that will be turned on simultaneously to open the door.
2. It handles the input of n lamps and their respective turning on and off times.
3. The functions defined in the program are used appropriately to calculate factorials, combinations, and other required operations modulo 998244353.
4. The program iterates through the lamps, calculates the cumulative sum of lamps being turned on and off at each time point, and then calculates the number of ways to choose k lamps based on the cumulative sums.
5. The output is calculated correctly and returned modulo 998244353.

Overall, the program seems to be correctly implementing the algorithm described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
