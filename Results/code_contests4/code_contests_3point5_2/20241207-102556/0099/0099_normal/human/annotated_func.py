    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list containing the elements [1, result, result * (be + 1), result * (be + 1) * (be + 2), ..., result * (be + 1) * (be + 2) * ... * en], `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `i` is equal to `en + 1`, `en` is greater than or equal to `be` for the loop to execute

    #The program returns a list containing elements [1, result, result * (be + 1), result * (be + 1) * (be + 2), ..., result * (be + 1) * (be + 2) * ... * en] based on the initial values of 'res', 'be', 'en', and 'result'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`. It initializes a list `res` with the element 1 and then iterates through a range starting from `be` to `en` (inclusive). During each iteration, it appends the result of multiplying the last element of `res` with the current value of `i`. Finally, it returns a list containing the elements [1, result, result * (be + 1), result * (be + 1) * (be + 2), ..., result * (be + 1) * (be + 2) * ... * en]. The function utilizes the initial value of 'res' and 'result' to perform these calculations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The input values for l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9.**

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The input values for l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9. n is greater or equal to r
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the division of the factorial of n by the factorial of (n-r)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `r` where 1 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The input values for `l_i` and `r_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9. If `n` is less than `r`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the division of the factorial of `n` by the factorial of (n-r).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list containing the cumulative sum of elements in `arr`
    return tem
    #The program returns the list `tem` containing the cumulative sum of elements in list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts a list `arr` and calculates the cumulative sum of elements in the list. It then returns a new list `tem` containing these cumulative sums. The function correctly implements the cumulative sum logic as described in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, 1 <= k <= n. Each l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9.**

    #The program returns a function that reads a line from the input buffer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It sets the standard output to a buffer, registers a lambda function to write the buffer contents to the output when the program exits, and then returns a function that reads a line from the input buffer.
