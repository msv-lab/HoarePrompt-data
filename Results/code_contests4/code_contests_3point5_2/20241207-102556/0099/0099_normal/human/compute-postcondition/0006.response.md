Example Answer:
`tem` is a list containing the updated elements after the operation is performed, and `i` is incremented by 1. The new calculated value, which is `tem[i] + arr[i]`, is appended to `tem` for the loop to execute one more time. 
Output State: **`tem` is a list containing the updated elements after the operation is performed, `i` is incremented by 1, and the new calculated value is appended to `tem` for the loop to execute one more time**
