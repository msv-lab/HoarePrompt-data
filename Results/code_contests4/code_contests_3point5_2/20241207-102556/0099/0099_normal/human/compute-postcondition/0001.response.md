Example Answer:
The code snippet registers a lambda function to be executed at exit. This lambda function writes the output stored in `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())`. No variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, 1 <= k <= n.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, 1 <= k <= n**
