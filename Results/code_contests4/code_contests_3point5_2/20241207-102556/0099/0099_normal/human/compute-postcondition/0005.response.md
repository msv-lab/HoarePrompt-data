According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tem` is a list containing the updated elements, `i` is at a certain value, and the length of `arr` is the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the new calculated value needs to be appended to `tem`.
State: **`tem` is a list containing the updated elements after the operation is performed, `i` is incremented by 1, and the new calculated value is appended to `tem` for the loop to execute one more time**
