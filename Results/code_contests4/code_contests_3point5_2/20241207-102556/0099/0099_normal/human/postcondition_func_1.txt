The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `r` where 1 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The input values for `l_i` and `r_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9. If `n` is less than `r`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the division of the factorial of `n` by the factorial of (n-r).
