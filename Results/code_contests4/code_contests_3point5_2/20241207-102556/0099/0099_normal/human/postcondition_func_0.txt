The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`. It initializes a list `res` with the element 1 and then iterates through a range starting from `be` to `en` (inclusive). During each iteration, it appends the result of multiplying the last element of `res` with the current value of `i`. Finally, it returns a list containing the elements [1, result, result * (be + 1), result * (be + 1) * (be + 2), ..., result * (be + 1) * (be + 2) * ... * en]. The function utilizes the initial value of 'res' and 'result' to perform these calculations.
