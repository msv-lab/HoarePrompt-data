You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a list containing the elements [1, result, result * (be + 1), result * (be + 1) * (be + 2), ..., result * (be + 1) * (be + 2) * ... * en], `be` is less than or equal to `en`, `i` is equal to `en + 1`, `en` is greater than or equal to `be` for the loop to execute
    return res
    #The program returns a list containing elements [1, result, result * (be + 1), result * (be + 1) * (be + 2), ..., result * (be + 1) * (be + 2) * ... * en] based on the initial values of 'res', 'be', 'en', and 'result'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `be` and `en`. It initializes a list `res` with the element 1 and then iterates through a range starting from `be` to `en` (inclusive). During each iteration, it appends the result of multiplying the last element of `res` with the current value of `i`. Finally, it returns a list containing the elements [1, result, result * (be + 1), result * (be + 1) * (be + 2), ..., result * (be + 1) * (be + 2) * ... * en]. The function utilizes the initial value of 'res' and 'result' to perform these calculations.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The input values for l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9.**
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The input values for l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9. n is greater or equal to r
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the division of the factorial of n by the factorial of (n-r)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `r` where 1 <= k <= n <= 3 * 10^5. The input values for `l_i` and `r_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9. If `n` is less than `r`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the division of the factorial of `n` by the factorial of (n-r).

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tem` is a list containing the cumulative sum of elements in `arr`
    return tem
    #The program returns the list `tem` containing the cumulative sum of elements in list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_3 accepts a list `arr` and calculates the cumulative sum of elements in the list. It then returns a new list `tem` containing these cumulative sums. The function correctly implements the cumulative sum logic as described in the annotations.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, 1 <= k <= n. Each l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= 10^9.**
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a function that reads a line from the input buffer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It sets the standard output to a buffer, registers a lambda function to write the buffer contents to the output when the program exits, and then returns a function that reads a line from the input buffer.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
