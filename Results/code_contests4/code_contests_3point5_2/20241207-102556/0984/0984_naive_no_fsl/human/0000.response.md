Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It finds the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum value in the array, rather than finding the subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. The logic implemented in the program is incorrect based on the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is false.
