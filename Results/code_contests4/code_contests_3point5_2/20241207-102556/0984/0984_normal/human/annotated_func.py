#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer value read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 reads an integer value from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer. The array a contains n non-negative integers.**
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers extracted from the input read from sys.stdin.readline().split()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing the integers extracted from the input read from sys.stdin.readline().split(). It lacks error handling for cases where the input is not in the expected format or if the input is empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns the input read from the standard input after removing any trailing whitespace characters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the input read from the standard input after removing any trailing whitespace characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a list of integers with length at least 1 and at most 10^5. Each integer in args is between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: No change in the state. The loop iterates through the list of integers in args and prints each integer followed by a space. There are no variable updates or changes in relationships between variables after the loop finishes executing.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and operates on a global variable `args`, which is a list of integers. It iterates through the `args` list and prints each integer followed by a space. The function does not return any value directly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `args` have been written to the standard output
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` iterates over the elements in `args` and writes each element to the standard output. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.
