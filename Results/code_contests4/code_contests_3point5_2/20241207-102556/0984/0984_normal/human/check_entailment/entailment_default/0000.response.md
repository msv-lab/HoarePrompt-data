Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the length of the array and the array elements from standard input.
- It then calculates the maximum element in the array and the number of times it appears consecutively.
- It keeps track of the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of the maximum element.
- Finally, it prints the length of the longest subsegment with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.

The code seems to follow the problem description and correctly identifies the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. The output hints do not provide any contradicting cases, and the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
