Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to find the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. However, the code provided does not actually implement the logic to find the longest subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean. It only reads input, but there is no implementation of the required logic for finding the longest subsegment.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
