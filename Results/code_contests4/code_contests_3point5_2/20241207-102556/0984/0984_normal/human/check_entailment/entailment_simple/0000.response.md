Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of functions that read input from standard input, process the input, and then print the output to standard output. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` handle reading the input, while `func_4` and `func_5` handle printing the output.

The program reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`. It then calculates the subsegment with the maximum arithmetic mean and finds the longest subsegment among all subsegments with the maximum arithmetic mean.

The program correctly follows the problem description as it reads the input, calculates the required values, and prints the output as specified in the problem description. The functions in the program work together to achieve the desired result, making the program correct for the given problem.
