Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the shortest distance between two points on a square. The logic in the `func_1` function seems incorrect and does not accurately represent the shortest path between the two points. To illustrate, let's consider the following input:

Input:
```
2 0 0 1 0
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the given program will output `4` for this input, which is incorrect. This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
