Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` in the code is not correctly computing the shortest distance between two points on a square. The output hints describe the conditions under which the function should return specific values based on the input parameters. However, the code does not handle all these conditions correctly.

For example, if we take the input:
```
2 0 0 1 0
```
The expected output should be 1, as the shortest distance between the points is along the side of the square. However, the code provided does not produce the correct output for this case.

Therefore, based on the discrepancy between the code's functionality and the problem description, the correctness of the code is **False**.
