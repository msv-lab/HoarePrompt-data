Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the shortest distance between two points on the square by considering the possible cases where the points are located on the sides of the square. The program returns the correct distance for each case as described in the problem statement. It handles the scenarios where the points are on different sides of the square and calculates the shortest path accordingly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
