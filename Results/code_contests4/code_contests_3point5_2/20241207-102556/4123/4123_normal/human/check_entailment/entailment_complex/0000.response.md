Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes inputs representing the side length of a square and the coordinates of two points on the square. It then calculates the shortest distance between the two points based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program returns the correct shortest distance for all possible cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
