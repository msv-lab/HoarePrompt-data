The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the side length of the square. `x`, `y`, `x1`, `y1` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, x1, y1 <= n.

After executing the function body, the program has multiple return cases:
- Case 1: The program returns the value of 'x' which is a non-negative integer.
- Case 2: The program returns the sum of `y` and `n`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the side length of a square, and `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= y <= n.
- Case 3: The program returns `2n - x`.
- Case 4: The program returns `3n - y`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, and based on the specified cases, return different values calculated using these parameters and the side length of the square `n`.
