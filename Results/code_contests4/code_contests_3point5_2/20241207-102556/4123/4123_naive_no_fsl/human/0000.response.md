Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the shortest distance between two points on a square as described in the problem. The logic in the `func_1` function is incorrect and does not handle all possible cases of the points lying on the sides of the square. For example, if the points are located at (0, 0) and (2, 1) on a square with side length 2, the expected shortest distance is 1, but the program would output 6. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
