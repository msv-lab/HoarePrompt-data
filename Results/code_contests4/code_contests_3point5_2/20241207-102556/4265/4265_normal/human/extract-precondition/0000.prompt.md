You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sir Lancelot, the chief Royal General. He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite the King to come and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the fighting techniques and tactics of the squad he was in charge of. But time went by and one day Sir Lancelot had a major argument with the Fairy Godmother (there were rumors that the argument occurred after the general spoke badly of the Godmother's flying techniques. That seemed to hurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply). 

As the result of the argument, the Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the general. It sounded all complicated and quite harmless: "If the squared distance between some two soldiers equals to 5, then those soldiers will conflict with each other!"

The drill exercises are held on a rectangular n × m field, split into nm square 1 × 1 segments for each soldier. Thus, the square of the distance between the soldiers that stand on squares (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) equals exactly (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2. Now not all nm squad soldiers can participate in the drill exercises as it was before the Fairy Godmother's curse. Unless, of course, the general wants the soldiers to fight with each other or even worse... For example, if he puts a soldier in the square (2, 2), then he cannot put soldiers in the squares (1, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1) and (4, 3) — each of them will conflict with the soldier in the square (2, 2).

Your task is to help the general. You are given the size of the drill exercise field. You are asked to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on this field, so that no two soldiers fall under the Fairy Godmother's curse.

Input

The single line contains space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) that represent the size of the drill exercise field.

Output

Print the desired maximum number of warriors.

Note

In the first sample test Sir Lancelot can place his 4 soldiers on the 2 × 4 court as follows (the soldiers' locations are marked with gray circles on the scheme):

In the second sample test he can place 6 soldiers on the 3 × 4 site in the following manner:
