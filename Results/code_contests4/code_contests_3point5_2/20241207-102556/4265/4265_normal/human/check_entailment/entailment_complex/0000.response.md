Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field without conflicting with each other, but the provided program simply calculates the product of n and m and then divides it by 2, which does not solve the problem described. The program should actually calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field without any two soldiers being at a squared distance of 5 from each other.
