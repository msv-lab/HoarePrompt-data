Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply calculates the product of `n` and `m`, then divides it by 2, and prints the result. However, the problem description requires finding the maximum number of soldiers that can be positioned on the field so that no two soldiers fall under the Fairy Godmother's curse. This involves a specific pattern of placing soldiers to avoid conflicts based on the squared distance between them. The code does not implement this logic and simply calculates a mathematical operation on `n` and `m`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
