Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map` and `int`. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
