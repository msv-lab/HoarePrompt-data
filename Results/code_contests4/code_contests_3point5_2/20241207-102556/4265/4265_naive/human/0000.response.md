Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on the field without conflict. The program simply multiplies the values of n and m and divides it by 2 without considering the constraints imposed by the Fairy Godmother's curse. 

For example, if the input is 2 2, the correct output should be 2. However, the program would output 2.0 instead of 2.
