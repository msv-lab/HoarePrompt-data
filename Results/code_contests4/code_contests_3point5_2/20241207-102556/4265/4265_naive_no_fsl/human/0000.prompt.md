You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sir Lancelot, the chief Royal General. He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite the King to come and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the fighting techniques and tactics of the squad he was in charge of. But time went by and one day Sir Lancelot had a major argument with the Fairy Godmother (there were rumors that the argument occurred after the general spoke badly of the Godmother's flying techniques. That seemed to hurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply). 

As the result of the argument, the Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the general. It sounded all complicated and quite harmless: "If the squared distance between some two soldiers equals to 5, then those soldiers will conflict with each other!"

The drill exercises are held on a rectangular n × m field, split into nm square 1 × 1 segments for each soldier. Thus, the square of the distance between the soldiers that stand on squares (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) equals exactly (x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2. Now not all nm squad soldiers can participate in the drill exercises as it was before the Fairy Godmother's curse. Unless, of course, the general wants the soldiers to fight with each other or even worse... For example, if he puts a soldier in the square (2, 2), then he cannot put soldiers in the squares (1, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1) and (4, 3) — each of them will conflict with the soldier in the square (2, 2).

Your task is to help the general. You are given the size of the drill exercise field. You are asked to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on this field, so that no two soldiers fall under the Fairy Godmother's curse.

Input

The single line contains space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) that represent the size of the drill exercise field.

Output

Print the desired maximum number of warriors.

Examples

2 4


Output

4

Input

3 4


Output

6

Note

In the first sample test Sir Lancelot can place his 4 soldiers on the 2 × 4 court as follows (the soldiers' locations are marked with gray circles on the scheme):

In the second sample test he can place 6 soldiers on the 3 × 4 site in the following manner:

Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
print(n * m) / 2
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
