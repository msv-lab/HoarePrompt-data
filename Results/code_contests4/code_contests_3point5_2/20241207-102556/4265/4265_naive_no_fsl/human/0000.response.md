Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The output should be the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field without any conflicts, which is calculated as (n * m) / 2. However, the program simply prints n * m without dividing by 2, leading to incorrect results for most cases. For example, for the input "3 4", the correct output should be 6, but the program would output 12. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be placed on the field without conflicts.
