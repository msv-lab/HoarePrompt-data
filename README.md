**HoarePrompt - Data**

Welcome to the **HoarePrompt Data Repository**, a structured repository containing scripts, datasets, and experimental results for HoarePrompt. This repository serves as the foundation for processing, analyzing, and improving structural reasoning about programs in natural language.

---

## Repository Structure

### 1. Scripts
The `scripts/` folder contains all Python scripts used for data processing, analysis, and post-processing. Each script is documented in detail in a dedicated Markdown file.

ðŸ“„ **Path:** [scripts/scripts.md](scripts/scripts.md)

---

### 2. Datasets
The `PilotData/data/` folder contains datasets used for experimentation. Each dataset is described with its contents and purpose.

ðŸ“„ **Path:** [PilotData/data/dataset.md](PilotData/data/dataset.md)

---

### 3. Results
The `Results/` folder contains results and confidence calculation metrics for various experiments. Each subfolder includes the following:

- **`config.json`**: Configuration file for the experiment.
- **`repo_commit_id.txt`**: Commit ID of the repository at the time of the experiment.
- **`datetime.txt`**: Timestamp for when the experiment was conducted.

This structure ensures reproducibility and traceability of all experiments.

ðŸ“‚ **Path:** `Results/`
