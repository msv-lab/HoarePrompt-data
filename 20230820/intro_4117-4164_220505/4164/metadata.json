Let's analyze and discuss the issues one by one:\n\n1. **Incorrect calculation of `area_ratio`**: \n    - In the code, `area_ratio` is calculated by dividing the area of a circle with radius `r` by the area of a circle with radius 1. \n    - However, the formula used to calculate the area of a circle is incorrect. \n    - The formula `math.pi * r  ** 2 / math.pi` is equivalent to `r ** 2` which gives the area of the circle with radius `r`.\n    - The correct formula to calculate the area of a circle is `math.pi * r ** 2`.\n    - This leads to incorrect calculation of `area_ratio` and therefore incorrect output.\n\n2. **Incorrect conversion of `area_ratio` to an integer**:\n    - After calculating the `area_ratio`, the code casts it to an integer using the `int()` function.\n    - However, this casting is unnecessary and can be removed.\n    - The problem statement clearly states that the answer will always be an integer.\n    - Therefore, the calculation of `area_ratio` itself should produce an integer.\n\nLet's correct these issues to fix the bugs in the code.",
