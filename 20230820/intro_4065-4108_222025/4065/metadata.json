          "feedback": "### REVIEW\nThe program has the following bugs:\n\n1. The condition inside the if statement is not correct. It should check if the next difficulty is greater than the current difficulty but not greater than twice the current difficulty.\n2. The loop is not correctly iterating through the problems in the problemset. It should iterate from the second problem (index 1) to the last problem (index n-1), but the current implementation iterates from the first problem (index 0) to the second-to-last problem (index n-2).\n3. The valid_contests variable is not being initialized correctly. It should be initialized to 0 instead of 1, since the problemset can have valid contests with only one problem.\n4. The loop breaks when the condition is not satisfied, but it should continue iterating through the remaining problems to check if they can form valid contests.\n5. The code does not consider all possible valid contests. It only counts the number of individual problems that satisfy the condition, but it does not consider combinations of problems that can form valid contests.\n\n### IMPACT\nThese bugs have a significant impact on the functionality of the program. The program is currently only counting individual problems that satisfy the condition, but it should consider all possible valid contests. As a result, the program may not find the maximum number of problems that can form a valid contest. Additionally, the incorrect conditions and loop iteration may cause the program to miss valid contests or count invalid contests as valid. As a result, the output may not be correct and the program may not solve the problem as intended.",
