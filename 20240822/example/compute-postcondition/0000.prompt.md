You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing Hoare triples. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations.
"""n can be any value"""
n = int(input())

Postcondition: **n is an input integer**
"""n is either 3 or 5"""
m = n + 1

Postcondition: **n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6**
"""x is greater than zero"""
x = x + 1

Postcondition: **x greater than one**
"""n is a bool value"""
num = 5

Postcondition: **n is a bool value, num is 5**
"""i is integer"""
i += 1

Postcondition: **i is integer and i is increased by 1**
"""variables can hold any values"""
raise ValueError('An error occurred')

Postcondition: **ValueError is raised**
"""variables can hold any values"""
return True

Postcondition: **the function return True**
"""n is an integer, m is 2"""
if n < m:
    return True
    """the function return True"""

Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is 2. If n is less then 2, then the function return True**
"""n is an integer greater than 1.**"""
m = 2
