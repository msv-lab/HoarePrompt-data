You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing Hoare triples. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations.
"""n is an integer greater than 1, m is 2. If n is less than m, the function returns True; otherwise, it does not return anything."""
if n % i == 0:
    return True

Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 1, m is 2. If n is less than m and n is divisible by i, the function returns True; otherwise, it does not return anything.**
"""n is an integer greater than 1, m is 2. If n is less than m, the function returns True; otherwise, it does not return anything."""
for i in range(2, n):
    if n % i == 0:
        return True
