The value of `n` remains unchanged.","n is a positive integer (i.e., n > 0). The function `func` returns True if n is not a prime number, and False if n is a prime number.","Explanation: The postcondition specifies that the function unconditionally returns `True` without completing the loop, indicating that the integer `n` is not a prime number. The provided function does not unconditionally return `True` without completing the loop. Instead, it returns `True` as soon as it finds a factor of `n` in the range [2, √n]. This behavior correctly identifies non-prime numbers by checking for divisibility within the specified range.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function iterates from 2 to the square root of n and checks if n is divisible by any number in that range. If n is divisible by any number in that range, then the function returns True indicating that n is not a prime number. Otherwise, it returns False if n is not divisible by any number in the range, which implies that n is a prime number.

The function then returns the product of the calculated area and the length of side `c`.","a, b, and c are positive real numbers such that a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function `func` calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula and returns the product of the area and the length of side `c`.","Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula, which is half the area of the triangular prism's base. However, the function is expected to find the volume of the triangular prism, not just the area of the base. To find the volume of a triangular prism, the area of the base should be multiplied by the height of the prism (side 'c' in this case). Therefore, the function should return the product of the calculated area and the length of side 'c' to find the volume of the triangular prism.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The given code calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula but incorrectly returns the product of the area and the length of side `c` as the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism is given by the formula: base area * height. In this case, the base area is the area of the triangle, but the height of the prism along the side `c` should be considered for volume calculation. Therefore, the function does not correctly calculate the volume of a triangular prism based on the given specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` calculates the volume of a triangular prism given the base triangle sides `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function first calculates the area of the base triangle using Heron's formula, where `s` represents the semi-perimeter of the triangle. However, the function incorrectly multiplies the calculated area by the height `c` of the prism to find the volume. To calculate the volume of a triangular prism correctly, you need to multiply the base area by the height of the prism. Therefore, the function does not correctly compute the volume of the triangular prism as per the specification.

It should return `True` otherwise. The given implementation of the function checks for uppercase letters and digits correctly, but it does not check for the specific condition of sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore. The condition `re.search('_', text)` only checks for the presence of an underscore in the text but does not verify if the lowercase letters are joined with underscores as required by the specification. Therefore, the function does not fully meet the given specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function should return True if the input string contains an underscore but not two consecutive underscores, does not contain uppercase letters or numbers; otherwise, it should return False.

The function then returns the modified string.","Explanation: The postcondition statement does not match the actual behavior of the function. The function provided in the code snippet reverses only the vowels of the given string `s`. It does not move non-vowel characters to the end of the string. The function correctly reverses the vowels while keeping the non-vowel characters in their original positions. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification provided in the postcondition.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The given function `func` correctly reverses only the vowels in the string `s` by moving the vowels to the end while maintaining the order of other characters. It achieves this by using two pointers i and j to traverse the string from the start and end respectively, swapping vowels if found at both positions. The function then returns the modified string with reversed vowels. Hence, the function meets the postcondition as it correctly reverses only the vowels of the given string.

",False,True,True,False,The function `func` takes a parameter `string` which is a string. The return value is the count of non-empty substrings of the input `string`.,Input: `string` is a string. Output: the function `func` returns the number of non-empty substrings in `string`.,"Explanation: The function provided correctly counts the number of non-empty substrings of a given string by generating all possible substrings and filtering out the empty ones. The comprehension `[[string[i:j+1] for j in range(i,len(string))] for i in range(len(string))]` generates all substrings of the input string, and then the condition `len(s) > 0` is used to filter out the empty substrings. Finally, `sum` is used to count the remaining non-empty substrings. The function satisfies the postcondition by counting the number of non-empty substrings correctly.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The code provided correctly counts the number of non-empty substrings of the given string by calculating all possible substrings and then filtering out the empty ones. The list comprehension generates all substrings of the input string, and the sum function counts the non-empty substrings. Therefore, the program accurately implements the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` attempts to count the number of non-empty substrings of a given string by creating a list of all substrings using list comprehension and then counting the substrings with length greater than 0. However, the implementation is overly complex and contains unnecessary nested list comprehensions. It is difficult to follow and unnecessarily convoluted for such a simple task. The function can be simplified by directly calculating the number of non-empty substrings using the formula `(n*(n+1))/2`, where `n` is the length of the input string.

It calculates and returns the sum of the reciprocals of integers from 2 to n (exclusive).,n is a positive integer such that n > 1. The function func(n) calculates the sum of the reciprocals of integers from 2 to n-1 (inclusive).,"Explanation: The function correctly calculates the sum of the reciprocals of integers from 2 to n-1 (exclusive) for a given positive integer n where n > 1. The list comprehension `[1/i for i in range(2,n)]` generates the reciprocals of integers from 2 to n-1 and then the `sum()` function computes their sum. The code meets the postcondition as it correctly calculates the harmonic sum of n-1.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func(n)` calculates the sum of the reciprocals of integers from 2 to n-1 (inclusive), as specified in the postcondition. The implementation correctly calculates the harmonic sum for n-1 by summing the reciprocals of integers from 2 to n-1. The loop range [2, n) and the sum calculation are consistent with the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` imports the `math` module but does not use it. It calculates the harmonic sum of `n-1` by creating a list comprehension that iterates over the range from 2 to `n-1` (inclusive) and calculates `1/i` for each `i` in that range. However, the function should calculate the harmonic sum up to `n-1`, which means the range should start from 1 instead of 2. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1, which could result in a division by zero error.

The function func returns the number of elements in the tuple tup before encountering the first tuple element.,"Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function `func` should iterate through the elements of the tuple `tup`, counting the number of elements processed before encountering the first tuple element. The function should return the count representing the number of elements processed before the first tuple element is encountered. The code provided correctly counts the number of elements before the first tuple element in the tuple `tup` and returns this count. The function does not modify the original tuple `tup`, which aligns with the postcondition. Hence, the function meets the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function is supposed to return the number of elements in the tuple `tup` before encountering the first tuple element. The code provided increments the count for each element in the tuple until it encounters a tuple element, at which point it breaks out of the loop. This behavior correctly aligns with the postcondition, as it accurately counts the elements before the first tuple element.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a tuple `tup` as input and initializes a counter `count` to 0. It then iterates over each element in the tuple. For each element, if the element is not a tuple, it increments the `count` by 1 and continues the iteration. If the element is a tuple, it increments the `count` by 1 again and exits the loop using `break`. This logic is incorrect because the function increments `count` even before encountering a tuple element, which leads to an incorrect count of elements before the tuple element.

            sum += i
    return sum
",False,True,False,False,"To find the overall postcondition for the loop, we need to consider the initial state and the effect of the loop body:

1. Initially, `sum` is set to 0, and the loop iterates over each `i` from 1 to `n`.
2. During each iteration, if both `n` is divisible by 2 and `i`, the value of `i` is added to `sum`.
3. The loop updates `sum` with the sum of values of `i` from 1 to `n` that are both divisible by 2 and `n`.
4. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Therefore, the overall postcondition for the loop is:
**After the loop execution, the variable `sum` contains the sum of values of `i` from 1 to `n` that are both divisible by 2 and `n`, while the variable `n` remains unchanged.**",n is a positive integer. The function `func` calculates the sum of all positive divisors of n that are even. The variable `sum` stores this sum.,Correctness: **True**.,"Explanation: The postcondition specifies that the function should calculate the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are even. However, the implemented function only checks for divisibility by 2 (`n % 2 == 0`) and not whether the divisor is even. This means that the function is incorrectly calculating the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are divisors of `n`. Since the function does not correctly calculate the sum of even divisors, it does not meet the postcondition.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts an integer `n` and initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates over numbers from 1 to `n`, checking if both `n` is even and `i` is a factor of `n`. If these conditions are met, `i` is added to the sum. However, this logic is incorrect for finding the sum of even factors of a number. To find the sum of even factors, the condition `(n % i == 0 and i % 2 == 0)` should be used to check if `i` is an even factor of `n`. The current implementation does not correctly identify and sum the even factors of the input number.

However, the current implementation of the function does not remove any lowercase substrings from the string `s`. Instead, it only appends uppercase letters to the `res` string.

Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function `func` is expected to take a string `s` as input, iterate through each character in `s`, and append any uppercase characters to the result string `res`, which is then returned. However, the specification in the postcondition states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from the given string, but the provided function only retains uppercase characters. Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specification as it does not remove lowercase substrings.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts a string `s` and initializes an empty string `res`.

The function updates the `low` and `high` indices to narrow down the search range using binary search. If the target is found at the mid-point, the function returns the index. If the target is not found, it returns the correct index where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The postcondition is satisfied as the function correctly determines the left insertion point for the target value in the sorted list.

Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` implements the binary search algorithm to find the left insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The algorithm correctly handles the cases where the target is found in the list and where the target is not found. The function returns the index where the target should be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of the list `arr` in all cases. The binary search algorithm efficiently finds the correct insertion point in a sorted list, meeting the postcondition requirements.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` attempts to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in a sorted array `arr` using binary search. The function initializes `low` and `high` as the start and end indices of the array, respectively. It then iteratively updates the `mid` index based on the comparison of the value at `mid` with the target value. If the target value is found, the function returns the index of the target value. Otherwise, it adjusts the `low` and `high` pointers accordingly. 

However, the function has a logical error in the final part of the code where it tries to determine the left insertion point. The conditions `arr[mid] < target` and `arr[mid-1] >= target` are incorrect for identifying the left insertion point. The correct way to find the left insertion point is to return `mid` when `arr[mid] >= target` and `arr[mid-1] < target`.

",False,True,False,False,"The function `func` takes a positive integer parameter `n`. If `n` is equal to 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function returns half of the result of `func(n-1)`. The program fragment calls `func(7)`.","n is a positive integer. After executing the program fragment, the function `func` is called with the argument 7, and the return value is 0.0078125.","Explanation: The function `func` is designed to calculate the geometric sum, where each term is half of the previous term. The base case `n == 1` correctly returns 1. The recursive calculation `func(n-1) * 0.5` is consistent with the geometric sum formula. When `func(7)` is called, it calculates the geometric sum correctly. The result 1.9921875 is the geometric sum of the series when n is 7.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The postcondition states that after executing the program fragment, the function `func` is called with the argument 7, and the return value is 0.0078125. However, the actual return value of the given code is 1.9921875, not 0.0078125. This discrepancy indicates that the code does not correctly calculate the geometric sum of n-1 as specified.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` calculates the geometric sum of `n-1` by recursively calling itself with `n-1` and multiplying the result by 0.5 each time until `n` reaches 1. However, the function is not correctly calculating the geometric sum as it should sum the series `1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(2^(n-1))`. The function is only multiplying by 0.5 at each step instead of adding the reciprocal of powers of 2. Therefore, the output of the function is incorrect for calculating the geometric sum.

748,Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.,"def capital_words_spaces(s):
  return ' '.join(word if word.islower() else word.capitalize() for word in s.split(""""))
",False,True,False,False,"The function `func` takes a string parameter `s`. The function returns a modified version of `s` where each word is converted to lowercase, except for the first letter of each word which is capitalized. The words are then joined back together with spaces in between.","s is a string. The function `func` takes a string input `s`, splits it into words based on spaces, and then joins these words back together with spaces in between. Each word in the output is either in lowercase or capitalized based on the original word in `s`.","Explanation: The code provided in the function correctly implements the postcondition. It splits the input string `s` into words, then processes each word by capitalizing the first letter and converting the rest of the letters to lowercase. Finally, it joins the modified words back together with spaces in between. This behavior aligns with the postcondition, making the function correct.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The postcondition specifies that the function should put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string. However, the provided implementation does not align with this specification. The function splits the string into words based on spaces and then joins them back together with spaces in between. It does not specifically handle words starting with capital letters as required by the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts a string `s` and splits it into words based on spaces. It then joins these words back together with spaces between them, except for words that start with capital letters. For words that start with capital letters, it capitalizes the entire word before joining. However, the implementation does not correctly identify words starting with capital letters. The condition `word.islower()` checks if all characters in the word are lowercase, not if the word starts with a capital letter. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the specification as it does not correctly insert spaces between words starting with capital letters.
