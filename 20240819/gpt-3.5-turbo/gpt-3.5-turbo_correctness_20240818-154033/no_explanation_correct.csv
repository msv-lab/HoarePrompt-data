Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function should return True if the input string `text` contains only lowercase letters and underscores, and False otherwise. The given function does not correctly implement this behavior. The function uses regular expressions to search for uppercase letters, digits, double underscores, or the absence of an underscore to return False. However, it does not correctly verify if the input string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore. The current implementation does not accurately check if the input string contains only lowercase letters and underscores. Thus, it does not meet the specification.

1. The function should count the number of non-empty substrings, not the sum of the lengths of those substrings.
2. The list comprehension used to generate substrings includes empty substrings as well, so the condition `len(s) > 0` is not sufficient to filter out the empty substrings.

",False,True,True,False,"The function `func` takes a string parameter `s`. The function splits `s` into words using a space delimiter, then constructs a new string by capitalizing each word that is not already in lowercase, and joins these modified words with spaces. The resulting string is then returned.","s is a string. The function `func` takes a string as input, splits it into words using space as a delimiter, then joins the words back together with spaces in between. If a word is lowercase, it remains unchanged; if it is not lowercase (i.e., uppercase or a mix of cases), it is capitalized before joining.","Explanation: The given function correctly implements the postcondition by splitting the input string `s` into words using a space delimiter, capitalizing words that are not already in lowercase, and then joining these modified words with spaces to form the output string. The function maintains the structure as specified in the postcondition.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` correctly splits the input string `s` into words using space as a delimiter and then joins the words back together with spaces in between. If a word is lowercase, it remains unchanged; if it is not lowercase, it is capitalized before joining. The function accurately implements the postcondition as it puts spaces between words starting with capital letters and maintains lowercase words. Therefore, the function meets the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts a string `s` and splits it into words based on spaces. It then joins these words back together with spaces in between, but if a word starts with a capital letter, it capitalizes the entire word before joining. This approach does not accurately insert spaces between words starting with capital letters. The condition `word.islower()` is used incorrectly because it checks if the entire word is in lowercase, not if the word starts with a capital letter. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the specification to put spaces between words starting with capital letters.
Correctness: **False**."
804,Write a function to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not.,"def is_product_even(lst):
	return not all(map(lambda x: x%2!=0, lst))
",True,False,False,True,"The function `func` takes a list of integers, `lst`. The function returns `True` if at least one element in `lst` is even (divisible by 2); otherwise, it returns `False`.","lst is a list of integers. The function func returns True if at least one element in lst is an even number, and False otherwise.","Explanation: The code provided does not match the given specification. The function `func` returns `True` if all elements in the list are odd, which is the opposite behavior to what is expected based on the specification. The specification states that the function should return `True` if at least one element in the list is even (divisible by 2), but the code checks if all elements are odd. Therefore, the code does not meet the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function should return True if at least one element in the list is an even number, and False otherwise. However, the implementation of the function is incorrect. The function actually returns True if all elements in the list are odd numbers and False otherwise. This is because the function uses the `all` function combined with a lambda function that checks if each element in the list is odd. The negation `not` of this result is then returned. This logic does not match the specified postcondition.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a list `lst` as input and applies a lambda function to check if each element in the list is odd (i.e., `%2 != 0`). The `map` function is used to apply this check to all elements in the list. The `all` function then checks if all elements in the mapped result are not odd, which implies that at least one element is even, making the product even. The negation `not` is used to return `True` when the product is even and `False` when the product is odd as per the specification. The function correctly determines whether the product of numbers in the list is even.

",True,False,False,True,"The function `func` takes a list of lists of numbers, `lstOfLst`. During the execution, the function iterates through each list `i` in `lstOfLst`. For each `i`, the sum of its elements is calculated. If this sum is greater than the current `maxSum`, `maxSum` is updated to this sum, and `maxList` is set to reference `i`. After processing all lists in `lstOfLst`, `maxSum` holds the maximum sum of elements in any list, and `maxList` refers to the list with that maximum sum. The function returns `maxList`, and the initial state of `lstOfLst` remains unchanged.","lstOfLst is a list of lists of numbers. After executing the function func(lstOfLst), maxList is a list within lstOfLst that has the highest sum compared to the sums of all other lists in lstOfLst. maxSum is the sum of the elements in maxList.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function iterates through each list `i` in `lstOfLst`, calculates the sum of its elements, and updates the `maxSum` and `maxList` variables accordingly. The function keeps track of the list with the highest sum correctly. However, the issue lies in the fact that the function does not handle the case where there are multiple lists with the same highest sum. In such scenarios, the function will only return the last list found with the highest sum, not all lists with the highest sum. As per the postcondition, the function should return the list (or lists) with the highest sum, which the provided code does not accomplish.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function `func(lstOfLst)` should return a list `maxList` within `lstOfLst` that has the highest sum compared to the sums of all other lists in `lstOfLst`. The function iterates through each list in `lstOfLst` and updates `maxList` if it finds a list with a higher sum. However, the issue lies in the initialization of `maxSum` and `maxList` outside the loop. This initialization only considers the case where all lists have non-negative numbers, and it fails to handle cases where the sums could be negative. Additionally, if all lists have sums less than or equal to 0, the function will return an empty list. This behavior does not meet the specification as it should return a non-empty list even if all sums are less than or equal to 0.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a list of lists `lstOfLst` and initializes `maxSum` to 0 and `maxList` to an empty list. It iterates over each list `i` in `lstOfLst` and compares the sum of elements in list `i` with the current `maxSum`. If the sum of elements in list `i` is greater than `maxSum`, the function updates `maxSum` to this new sum and `maxList` to list `i`. Consequently, the function returns the list with the highest sum of elements. This implementation correctly identifies the list in `lstOfLst` with the highest sum of elements.
