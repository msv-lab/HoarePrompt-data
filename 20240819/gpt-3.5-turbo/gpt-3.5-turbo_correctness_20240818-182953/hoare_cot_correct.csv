",False,False,True,True,"Given positive real numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, the function `func` calculates the semi-perimeter `s` as `(a + b + c) / 2`, computes the area of the triangle using Heron's formula as `area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`, and finally returns the area of the triangle multiplied by `c`.","a, b, and c are positive real numbers such that they are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function func calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula and returns the area multiplied by the length of side c.","Explanation: The given function calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula and then incorrectly returns the area multiplied by the height `c` as the volume of a triangular prism. This calculation is incorrect as the volume of a triangular prism should be the area of the triangle base multiplied by the height of the prism. Therefore, the function does not correctly compute the volume of a triangular prism according to the given specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function correctly calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula given the sides a, b, and c which are positive real numbers. It then multiplies the area by the length of side c to find the volume of the triangular prism, not just the area of the triangle. The function meets the specification by calculating the volume of a triangular prism as required.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The code provided calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula: volume = area of the base triangle * height. However, the code has a couple of issues:
1. The code uses `area` as the variable name for the area of the triangular base, but it should be using `base_area` to avoid confusion with volume.
2. The code is missing the `import math` statement, which is required for using `math.sqrt`.

To correct these issues, the code should be modified as follows:
```python
import math

def func(a, b, c):
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    base_area = math.sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
    return base_area * c

After making these corrections, the function should be able to correctly calculate the volume of a triangular prism.

At each iteration, it checks if the least significant bit of `n` is 1 (using the bitwise AND operation `n & 1`). If at any point during the iteration, `n` has a bit set other than the least significant bit, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` cannot be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2.

- In each iteration, the value of `i` is increased by 1, and `sum` is updated by adding the cube of `i` to its current value.

If the angle is greater than 360, the function returns `None`; otherwise, it returns the area of the sector calculated using the formula: (angle / 360) * π * radius^2.","Explanation: The function `func` correctly follows the postcondition. It first checks if the angle is greater than 360 degrees and returns `None` in that case. If the angle is not greater than 360 degrees, it proceeds to calculate the area of the sector using the formula specified and returns the result. The function behaves as expected based on the provided specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, if the angle is greater than 360, the function correctly returns `None`. When the angle is less than or equal to 360, the function calculates the area of the sector using the provided formula. However, the formula used to calculate the area of the sector is incorrect. The correct formula should be `(angle/360) * π * radius^2`, but the given code uses `(angle/360) * π * radius^2`. This difference renders the implementation incorrect as it does not accurately compute the area of the sector.

",False,False,True,True,"The function `func` takes two list parameters, `lst1` and `lst2`. After execution, it returns a tuple containing the unique elements present in `lst1` that are not in `lst2`. Both `lst1` and `lst2` remain lists.",lst1 and lst2 are lists. The function returns a tuple containing the elements that are present in lst1 but not in lst2.,"Explanation: The implementation of the function `func` is incorrect with respect to the given postcondition. The function is using sets to find the unique elements present in `lst1` that are not in `lst2`, and then converting the result back to a list and then to a tuple. This implementation does not preserve the order of elements in the list, and it also converts the result to a tuple unnecessarily. The postcondition specifies that both `lst1` and `lst2` should remain lists after execution. This function violates the postcondition as it converts the output to a tuple and does not preserve the order of elements.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function in the code snippet correctly computes the elements that are present in lst1 but not in lst2 by converting the lists to sets, finding the set difference, converting the result back to a list, and then to a tuple. This adheres to the postcondition which specifies returning a tuple containing elements present in lst1 but not in lst2. The function implementation is consistent with the given specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes two lists `lst1` and `lst2`, converts them to sets to find the unique elements in `lst1` that are not present in `lst2`, converts the resulting set back to a list, and then converts the list to a tuple before returning it. This function correctly computes the difference between two lists by finding elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.

After iterating through all lists in `lstOfLst`, `maxSum` holds the maximum sum of values among all lists, `maxList` holds the list with that maximum sum, and the original lists in `lstOfLst` remain unchanged. The function returns `maxList`.","lstOfLst is a list of lists of numbers. After the execution of the function `func`, maxList contains the list within lstOfLst that has the maximum sum of its elements.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function `func` correctly iterates through each list in `lstOfLst` and compares the sum of the values in each list `i` with the current maximum sum, `maxSum`. If the sum of `i` is greater than `maxSum`, `maxSum` is updated to be the sum of `i`, and `maxList` is updated to be `i`.

The function returns `maxList`. This behavior is consistent with the postcondition.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function iterates over the lists in `lstOfLst` and updates `maxList` with the list that has the maximum sum of elements. However, the function does not handle cases where there could be multiple lists with the same maximum sum. It only keeps track of the list with the maximum sum found so far. This means that if there are multiple lists with the same maximum sum, the function will only return the last list it encounters with that sum, not all of them. As the specification does not specify this behavior, the function does not meet the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts a list of lists `lstOfLst`. It initializes `maxSum` to 0 and `maxList` to an empty list. It then iterates over each list `i` in `lstOfLst`, calculates the sum of elements in list `i` using `sum(i)`, and compares it with `maxSum`. If the sum of elements in list `i` is greater than `maxSum`, it updates `maxSum` to that sum and sets `maxList` to list `i`. This process continues until all lists are checked. However, the function should return the list with the highest sum of elements, not the sum itself. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification.
