If the initial value of `n` is even, the function directly returns `False` without any change to `n`.","Postcondition: n is an integer. The function `func` returns True if the binary representation of n contains a 1, otherwise it returns False.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function `func` returns `True` if the initial value of `n` is odd after halving `n` until it becomes 0. If the initial value of `n` is even, the function directly returns `False` without any change to `n`. However, the postcondition does not match the given code. The code checks if `n` is a power of 2 or not. It returns `True` if `n` is a power of 2 and `False` if it is not. The code does not check if the number can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2 as specified in the postcondition.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function returns True if the binary representation of n contains a 1, otherwise, it returns False. The given function `func` checks whether the binary representation of n contains a 1 by bitwise shifting n to the right until it reaches 0. If it encounters a 1 during the shifting process, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This approach is correct because in the binary representation of a number, if there is a 1 bit, it indicates that the number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2. Therefore, the function meets the given specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes an integer `n` and repeatedly checks if `n` is divisible by 2. It continues right-shifting `n` by 1 bit until `n` becomes zero. If at any point during this process `n` becomes odd (i.e., the least significant bit of `n` is 1), the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` cannot be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. Otherwise, if `n` becomes zero, the function returns `False`, implying that `n` can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. The function correctly determines whether the given number can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2.

The function calculates `clear_bits_mask` as a mask with all bits from position 0 to `end-1` set to 1, except for the bit at position `start-1` which is set to 0. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns `False`.","number is an integer, start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end <= the number of bits in the binary representation of number. The function func returns True if the bits in the binary representation of number from position start to position end are all clear (0), otherwise it returns False.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function should return `False` regardless of the input values. However, the implementation of the function involves bitwise operations that check if all the bits are unset in the given range, and returns `True` if that's the case. This contradicts the postcondition as it states that the function should always return `False`. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The given function `func` correctly uses a clear_bits_mask to check whether all the bits in the range from position `start` to position `end` are unset (0) in the binary representation of the `number`. The mask is created by setting all bits from 0 to `end` to 1 and then clearing the bits from 0 to `start - 1`. The function then checks if `number` and the clear_bits_mask are equal to the clear_bits_mask, which indicates that all the bits in the specified range are unset.

Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes three parameters: `number`, `start`, and `end`. It calculates a mask `clear_bits_mask` to unset all bits from the `start` to `end` positions (inclusive). It then performs a bitwise AND operation between the `number` and the `clear_bits_mask`. If the result is equal to the `clear_bits_mask`, it means all the bits in the given range are unset, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The return value should be a list created by interleaving each element of `lst` with the object `element`. However, the given implementation does not meet the postcondition requirements. The implementation inserts the `element` before each element in the list `lst`, but the interleaving requirement is not fulfilled. The list comprehension in the implementation does not correctly interleave the elements as specified. Therefore, the function implementation does not meet the postcondition.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function `func` is expected to return a new list where each element in `lst` is paired with the `element` object, and the `element` object is added before each pair of elements from `lst`.

If the condition is met, it appends the first word (before any space) to the `res` list. However, the function only appends the first word for words starting with 'p' or 'P' to `res`, as it uses `split()[0]` which discards any additional words in the string. The specification requires returning two words starting with 'p', but the current implementation does not ensure this. Additionally, the function returns the result as a tuple, which is not specified in the requirement.

The function `func` returns the result of subtracting p from k.","Explanation: The provided function `func` simply returns the result of the subtraction `k - p`. However, the postcondition states that the function should find the directrix of a parabola. The directrix of a parabola is a horizontal line located at a distance of `p` units below the vertex when the parabola opens upwards or `p` units above the vertex when the parabola opens downwards. Therefore, the function does not calculate the directrix of a parabola as specified.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the postcondition, the function `func` should return the result of subtracting `p` from `k`. The directrix of a parabola is typically given by the equation `y = k - p` when the parabola is in the form `(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)`. Therefore, this function accurately calculates the directrix of a parabola based on the provided parameters `h`, `k`, and `p`.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts three parameters `h`, `k`, and `p`, which represent the vertex form of a parabola `(h, k)` and the distance from the vertex to the focus `p`. In a parabola, the directrix is a horizontal line parallel to the x-axis and located `p` units below the vertex for a parabola opening upwards. Therefore, the correct formula for the directrix of a parabola is the equation of a horizontal line at `y = k + p`. The current implementation `k - p` does not correctly calculate the directrix of the parabola.

The function func returns the maximum negative integer from the list lst.,"Explanation: The postcondition specifies that the function should return the largest negative number from the given list if the list contains negative numbers. The function uses the `filter` function along with `max` to achieve this. However, the function does not handle the case when the list does not contain any negative numbers. Instead of raising a ValueError as specified in the postcondition, the function will raise a ValueError when there are no negative numbers in the list.
