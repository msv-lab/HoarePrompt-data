86,Write a function to find nth centered hexagonal number.,"def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return (n*(2*n-1) + 1)//2
",False,True,False,False,"`n` is an integer, and the function `func(n)` returns the value of the expression (n * (2 * n - 1) + 1) // 2 when called with `n`.",`n` is an integer; the function `func(n)` returns an integer value calculated as (n * (2 * n - 1) + 1) // 2.,"Explanation: According to the explanation, the function `func(n)` returns the value of the expression `(n * (2 * n - 1) + 1) // 2`. This expression correctly computes the nth centered hexagonal number, which is given by the formula \( H_n = \frac{n(2n-1)+1}{2} \). Thus, the function meets the specification as it correctly calculates the nth centered hexagonal number.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function calculates the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula `(n * (2 * n - 1) + 1) // 2`. However, the correct formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is `n * (3n - 2)`. The provided formula does not correspond to the definition of centered hexagonal numbers. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` is intended to compute the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula for centered hexagonal numbers, which is given by \((n \cdot (2n - 1)) + 1)/2\). The formula in the function does not correctly represent the centered hexagonal number, as the correct formula should be \((3n^2 - 3n + 1)\) for the nth centered hexagonal number. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect.
Correctness: **False**."
98,Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.,"import math
def multiply_num(num_list):
  mul = 1
  for i in num_list:
    mul *= i
  return mul/len(num_list)
",True,False,True,True,"`num_list` remains unchanged; the function returns the average of the products of all elements in `num_list`, where `mul` is the product of the elements in `num_list` divided by the length of `num_list`.",`num_list` is a list of non-zero numbers; the function `func` returns the product of all numbers in `num_list` divided by the length of `num_list`.,"Explanation: According to the explanation, the function is supposed to return the average of the products of all elements in `num_list`. However, the calculation `mul / len(num_list)` yields the product of the elements divided by the length of the list, not the average of the products. The correct interpretation of ""multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list"" would imply that the intended result is to return the product of all elements divided by the length, which the function does correctly. However, the explanation misrepresents the result as the average of the products rather than the product divided by the length. Thus, the explanation does not accurately reflect what the function does, leading to a misunderstanding of its purpose.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function correctly calculates the product of all numbers in `num_list` and divides it by the length of `num_list`. The specification is met as it states that `num_list` is a list of non-zero numbers, ensuring there are no division by zero errors. The behavior of the function aligns with the provided specification and explanation.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a list of numbers `num_list` as input. It initializes a variable `mul` to 1 and then iterates through each number in the list, multiplying them together. After the loop, it divides the total product `mul` by the length of the list `len(num_list)` and returns the result. The function correctly implements the specification of multiplying all the numbers in the list and then dividing by the length of the list. There are no issues with the logic or implementation.
Correctness: **True**."
142,Write a function to count number items that are identical in the same position of three given lists.,"def count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):
    count = 0

",True,False,True,True,"`count` is the total number of indices `i` (from 0 to the length of `list1` minus 1) where the elements at `list1[i]`, `list2[i]`, and `list3[i]` are equal; `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` remain unchanged.","`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of the same length; the function `func` returns the count of indices where the elements of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are equal.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function correctly counts the number of indices `i` where the elements at `list1[i]`, `list2[i]`, and `list3[i]` are equal. The logic used in the function iterates through the indices of `list1` and checks for equality among the three lists at the same index. The function operates correctly under the assumption that all three lists are of the same length. However, if the lists are not of the same length, this could lead to an IndexError. The specification does not mention handling lists of different lengths. Therefore, without additional checks for length equality, the function could produce an error in such cases, making it partially correct.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function iterates over the indices of the three lists and increments the count when the elements at the same index in all three lists are identical. The specification states that the lists are of the same length, and the function correctly counts the number of positions where the elements are identical across all three lists. Therefore, the function meets the specification. 
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes three lists as input and initializes a counter `count` to zero. It then iterates over the indices of the lists using a for loop. For each index `i`, it checks if the elements at that index in all three lists are identical (`list1[i] == list2[i] and list2[i] == list3[i]`). If they are, the counter is incremented. The function correctly counts the number of items that are identical in the same position across the three lists.

The explanation states that the function returns `sum`, which is equal to `n * (n // 2 + 1) - (n // 2) * (n // 2 + 1)`. However, the calculation of `sum` is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the series described in the specification. The expected sum should include stopping the loop when `n - 2*i` becomes less than or equal to `0`, which is not correctly handled in the given code. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification accurately.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The provided function calculates the sum of `n - 2*i` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n // 2`. This approach correctly implements the summation process as specified. The function iterates through the correct range and accumulates the correct values, fulfilling the requirement to sum the series until `n - 2*i` becomes non-positive. Thus, the function meets the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` computes the sum of the series starting from `n` and subtracting `2*i` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n // 2`. The loop iterates `n // 2 + 1` times, effectively including the term when `i` equals `n // 2`. This function will add up terms like `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, etc., which correctly matches the specification of summing until the term becomes non-positive. However, it does not stop summing when the computed value becomes less than or equal to zero, as specified in the requirement. It should only include terms that are greater than 0 in the sum.

",True,False,True,False,"`test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are tuples of the same length; `res` is a tuple where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of `test_tup1` by `test_tup2`, and the function `func` returns `res`.","`test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are tuples of the same length, all elements in `test_tup2` are non-zero; `res` is a tuple where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements of `test_tup1` by `test_tup2`.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function `func` performs an element-wise division of two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. The use of `zip` allows the function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously, and the comprehension creates a new tuple `res` containing the results of the division. The function correctly returns this tuple. However, there is no error handling for cases where an element in `test_tup2` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. Since the specification does not state how to handle such cases, this could lead to runtime errors, making the function potentially incorrect. 
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function takes two tuples and performs element-wise division, returning the resulting tuple. The code correctly implements this behavior, using `zip` to pair corresponding elements from both tuples and comprehensively dividing them. Since all elements in `test_tup2` are guaranteed to be non-zero, there will be no division by zero errors. Therefore, the function meets the specification accurately.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input. It uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to perform element-wise division of the corresponding elements from both tuples using `zip()`. The resulting tuple `res` contains the results of the division. However, the function does not handle the case where `y` (the divisor) is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. Since the specification does not mention error handling for division by zero, the function is considered incorrect.

However, the provided code does not correctly return the expected result based on the assertion. The assertion checks if the result of the function call equals `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is incorrect for the given input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. The actual bitwise AND results are `(0, 0, 2, 1)` as shown by the assertion, but the calculation is not done correctly in the function due to a misunderstanding of the tuples' values. Thus, the function does not meet the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function correctly uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to compute the elementwise result of the two input tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. The expected output for the input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)` is indeed `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, indicating that the function meets the specification. The assertion confirms that the output is as expected.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` attempts to perform an elementwise operation on two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). The result is constructed using a generator expression that zips the two tuples together, performing the operation on each corresponding pair of elements. However, the output does not match the expected output in the assertion, as the bitwise AND operation does not yield the expected results for the provided input. For example, the expected output for `(10 & 5)` is `2`, while the expected output in the assertion is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which indicates a misunderstanding of the operation being applied.

The function correctly calculates this directrix by returning `k - p`. Since the function aligns with the provided specification and explanation, it meets the requirements.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The provided function `func(h, k, p)` calculates `k - p`, which does not correctly represent the directrix of a parabola. The directrix of a parabola described by the vertex form \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \) is given by \( y = k - p \) if the parabola opens upwards or downwards; however, the specification does not clarify the orientation or context of the parabola, and the value of `h` is not used in the calculation. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification correctly.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes three parameters: `h`, `k`, and `p`. It is intended to calculate the directrix of a parabola given its vertex `(h, k)` and the distance `p` from the vertex to the directrix. The formula for the directrix of a parabola that opens upwards or downwards is given by `y = k - p`. The function correctly calculates the value of the directrix using the provided parameters. However, it does not return the complete information about the directrix (for example, it doesn't specify the line equation or where it is in relation to the parabola). Despite this, the function computes the correct value for the directrix as intended in the specification.

Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function correctly iterates through the list of integers `numbers`, counts the positive integers, and returns the ratio of positive integers to the total number of integers in the list. This behavior aligns with the specification, as it calculates the ratio of positive numbers accurately. However, if `numbers` is an empty list, this will result in a division by zero error. Since the function does not handle this edge case, it does not fully meet the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a list of integers `numbers` as input and initializes a counter `positive` to zero. It iterates through each `num` in the list and increments the `positive` counter for each positive number encountered. The function then returns the ratio of positive numbers by dividing the count of positive numbers by the length of the list. However, the function does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would lead to a division by zero error.

However, it does not handle the case where a sublist may be empty, which would raise an IndexError when attempting to access `sublist[0]`. According to the specification, the function should only consider non-empty sublists, but the current implementation does not account for that, making it incorrect. 
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function iterates over each sublist in the `numbers` list and appends the first element of each sublist to the `res` list, which is then returned. The specification states that `numbers` is a list of non-empty lists, and the code correctly handles this by accessing the first element of each sublist without any checks for emptiness. Therefore, this implementation meets the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a list of lists (sublists) called `numbers`. It initializes an empty list `res` to store the first elements. It then iterates through each `sublist` in `numbers` and appends the first element (`sublist[0]`) to `res`. The function assumes that each sublist has at least one element.

The implementation calculates the factorial correctly and retrieves the last digit by returning `fact % 10`. However, this approach fails for large values of `n`, as the factorial grows extremely large, potentially leading to performance issues or integer overflow in some environments. While the logic for obtaining the last digit is correct, the method of calculating the factorial is not efficient for larger integers (especially for `n >= 5`, where the last digit is always 0). Therefore, the implementation does not meet the specification in an efficient manner.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func(n)` calculates the factorial of `n` correctly and then returns the last digit of that factorial by using `fact % 10`. However, the computation of factorial for large values of `n` can be inefficient due to the rapid growth of the factorial value. Nevertheless, as per the specification and explanation, it correctly returns the last digit of the factorial of `n` for non-negative integers. Therefore, the function meets the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` computes the factorial of a given number `n` by multiplying integers from 2 to `n`. It then returns the last digit of the factorial by calculating `fact % 10`. This approach works correctly for small values of `n`.

The description mentions that `maxList` will reference the sublist with the maximum sum. However, there is a critical issue: the function returns `maxList`, which is expected to be a list, but it actually returns the last sublist that had the maximum sum, not the list itself. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it will only return the last one found, which is not consistent with the requirement to return the one with the highest sum.

Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` iterates over each list in `lstOfLst`, calculating the sum of its elements. It correctly updates `maxSum` and `maxList` whenever it finds a list with a higher sum. However, the implementation has a flaw: it assigns `maxList` directly to the current list `i` instead of maintaining it as a list (it should be `maxList = i[:]` or `maxList = list(i)`). As a result, if the same list object is referenced multiple times, it could lead to unintended behavior if the original lists are modified. Additionally, if `lstOfLst` is empty, the function would return an empty list, which is fine but not explicitly stated in the specification. Therefore, based on the provided explanation and the minor issue with list assignment, the overall functionality does meet the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a list of lists `lstOfLst`. It initializes `maxSum` to 0 and `maxList` to an empty list.
