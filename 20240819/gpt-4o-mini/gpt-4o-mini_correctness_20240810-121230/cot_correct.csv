59,Write a function to find the nth octagonal number.,"def is_octagonal(n):
    return (n*(3*n-1))//2
",False,True,False,True,"`n` is an integer, and the return value of `func(n)` is the result of the expression n * (3 * n - 1) divided by 2.",`n` is an integer; the function `func(n)` returns an integer value that is equal to `n` multiplied by `(3 * n - 1)` divided by 2.,"Explanation: The function `func(n)` computes the expression `(n * (3 * n - 1)) // 2`, which is the formula for the nth octagonal number. The specification correctly states that the function should return the nth octagonal number, and the formula used in the function is indeed the correct one for octagonal numbers. Therefore, the function meets the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func(n)` is intended to calculate the nth octagonal number. However, the formula used in the function is incorrect for octagonal numbers. The correct formula for the nth octagonal number is given by \(O(n) = n(3n - 2)\). The formula used in the function returns \( \frac{n(3n - 1)}{2} \), which does not yield the correct octagonal number. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts an integer `n` and computes the value using the formula `(n*(3*n-1))//2`. This formula is indeed the correct formula for the nth octagonal number, which is given by \( O_n = n(3n - 2) \). Therefore, the function correctly implements the specification to find the nth octagonal number. 
Correctness: **True**."
98,Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.,"import math
def multiply_num(num_list):
  mul = 1
  for i in num_list:
    mul *= i
  return mul/len(num_list)
",True,False,True,True,"`num_list` remains unchanged, `mul` is the product of all elements in `num_list`, and the function returns the average of the elements in `num_list` (i.e., `mul` divided by the length of `num_list`).",`num_list` is a list of non-zero numbers; the function `func(num_list)` returns the product of all elements in `num_list` divided by the length of `num_list`.,"Explanation: The function correctly multiplies all the numbers in `num_list` and divides the product by the length of the list. However, the explanation states that the function returns the average of the elements in `num_list`. This is misleading because the function actually returns the product of the numbers divided by the length, which is not the average of the elements in the list. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification as the explanation is incorrect.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function `func(num_list)` returns the product of all elements in `num_list` divided by the length of `num_list`. The provided code correctly implements this functionality, as it initializes `mul` to 1, multiplies each element of `num_list`, and then divides the final product by the length of `num_list`. Since `num_list` is specified to contain non-zero numbers, there are no issues with division by zero. Therefore, the function meets the specification.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a list of numbers `num_list` and initializes a variable `mul` to 1. It then iterates through each number in `num_list`, multiplying them together to obtain the product stored in `mul`. Finally, the function divides the product by the length of the list and returns the result. The function correctly implements the specification to multiply all the numbers in the list and divide by the length of the list. 
Correctness: **True**."
223,"Write a function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array. (The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.)","def is_majority(arr, n, x):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == x:
            count += 1
    if count > (n // 2):
        return True
    return False
",False,True,False,True,"`arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `count` holds the number of occurrences of `x` in the first `n` elements of `arr`, and the function returns `True` if `count` is greater than half of `n`, otherwise it returns `False`.","`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr), and `x` is an integer; the function returns True if `x` appears more than n/2 times in the first n elements of `arr`, and False otherwise.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function counts the occurrences of the element `x` in the sorted array `arr` and checks if this count is greater than `n/2`. This approach is valid for determining whether `x` is the majority element. Since the array is sorted, if `x` appears more than `n/2` times, it will be contiguous in the sorted array, ensuring that the count accurately reflects the number of occurrences. Therefore, the function meets the specification for identifying the majority element in a sorted array.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function iterates through the entire array `arr`, counting the occurrences of `x`. It then checks if the count of `x` is greater than `n/2`. However, the specification states that the function should determine if `x` is the majority element in the *given sorted array*, but the explanation indicates that it only considers the first `n` elements of `arr`. This could lead to incorrect results if the majority element spans beyond the first `n` elements, especially in cases where `n` is less than the length of `arr`. Therefore, the implementation does not correctly adhere to the specification.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes in a sorted array `arr`, its length `n`, and an element `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in the array using a loop. After counting, it checks if the count is greater than `n // 2` to determine if `x` is the majority element. However, while the function correctly counts occurrences and checks the condition for the majority element, it does not leverage the fact that the array is sorted, which could lead to a more efficient solution. Despite this inefficiency, the logic correctly determines if `x` is the majority element according to the specification. 
Correctness: **True**."
430,Write a function to find the directrix of a parabola.,"def parabola_directrix(h, k, p):
    return k - p
",False,True,False,False,"`h`, `k`, and `p` are real numbers, `p` is not equal to 0, and the function `func` returns the value of `k - p` when called with arguments `h`, `k`, and `p`.","`h`, `k`, and `p` are real numbers with `p` not equal to 0; the function returns `k - p`, which is a real number.","Explanation: The directrix of a parabola is defined in relation to the vertex (h, k) and the parameter p. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix is located at \( y = k - p \) when using the vertex form of the parabola equation. The function `func(h, k, p)` correctly computes the value of the directrix as `k - p`. Therefore, the function meets the specification of finding the directrix of a parabola.
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function is intended to find the directrix of a parabola defined by the vertex (h, k) and the distance p from the vertex to the directrix. The correct formula for the directrix of a parabola that opens upwards or downwards is `y = k - p` (for a parabola with vertex (h, k)). However, the provided function only returns a single value, `k - p`, and lacks any context or output structure to reflect that it is calculating the directrix. This means it does not fulfill the specification effectively, as it does not clearly express that it is calculating the directrix. Additionally, the specification does not mention whether the function should return the directrix as a line (e.g., in the form of an equation) or just a numerical value. Therefore, while mathematically it might appear correct for certain interpretations, it does not satisfactorily meet the specification requirements in a comprehensive manner.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts three parameters: `h`, `k`, and `p`. It calculates the directrix of a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, given its vertex \((h, k)\) and the distance \(p\) from the vertex to the directrix. The formula used in the function, `k - p`, is correct for the case when the parabola opens upwards. However, the specification does not provide enough detail about the orientation of the parabola (whether it opens upwards or downwards) or whether it also needs to handle parabolas opening sideways. As it stands, the function only handles one case and is not complete for the general specification.
Correctness: **False**."
446,Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.,"def count_Occurrence(tup,lst):
	res = dict()
	for i in lst:
		res[i] = 0
		for j in tup:
			if i == j:
				res[i] += 1
	return sum(res.values())
",True,False,True,False,"The function `func` returns the total count of occurrences of elements from `lst` that appear in `tup`, where `res` is a dictionary mapping each element from `lst` to its count of occurrences in `tup`.","`tup` is a tuple, `lst` is a list of hashable elements, `res` is a dictionary mapping each element in `lst` to its count of occurrences in `tup`, and the function returns an integer equal to the total number of occurrences of all elements in `lst` within `tup`.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function `func` returns the total count of occurrences of elements from `lst` that appear in `tup`. The code correctly initializes a dictionary `res` to count occurrences of each element in `lst`, iterates through `tup`, and sums the counts stored in `res`. However, the function does not correctly count occurrences of all elements in `tup` because it initializes each count to `0` every time it processes a new element from `lst`, rather than counting all occurrences directly. The output of the function is the total count of occurrences, which may not accurately reflect the counts of individual elements in `lst` as it sums the counts, but the specification is about counting occurrences of all elements. Therefore, it does not meet the specification as intended.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function correctly initializes a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It iterates through each element of `lst`, initializes its count to 0, and then checks each element of `tup` to see if it matches the current element from `lst`. If a match is found, it increments the count for that element. Finally, it returns the total count of occurrences by summing the values in the `res` dictionary. This meets the specification of counting the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple.

Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as inputs. It initializes an empty dictionary `res` to store the counts of each element in `lst`. For each element `i` in `lst`, it initializes its count to 0 and then iterates over each element `j` in the tuple `tup`. If `i` is equal to `j`, the count for that element in `res` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the sum of the counts of all elements in `res`. However, the specification asks for counting the occurrences of all elements of the list in the tuple, but the function only counts elements that are present in the list, not their occurrences directly. The returned value is the total count of all occurrences rather than a count of each element. Therefore, it does not fully meet the specification.

460,Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.,"def Extract(numbers):
    res = []
    for sublist in numbers:

However, the function does not handle the case where a sublist may be empty, which could lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[0]`. The specification implies that only non-empty sublists should be considered, but it does not explicitly state how to handle empty sublists. Thus, the function does not meet the specification as it may raise an error for empty sublists.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function iterates over each sublist in the list `numbers` and appends the first element of each sublist to the result list `res`. The explanation states that `numbers` is a list of non-empty lists, which means that accessing `sublist[0]` is safe and will not result in an index error. The function correctly returns a list containing the first element of each sublist as specified. 
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: The function `func` accepts a list of lists (sublists) called `numbers`. It initializes an empty list `res` to store the first elements of each sublist. The function then iterates over each `sublist` in `numbers` and appends the first element of each `sublist` (`sublist[0]`) to `res`. Finally, the function returns the list `res`. This implementation correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist as specified.

640,Write a function to remove the parenthesis and what is inbetween them from a string.,"import re
def remove_parenthesis(s):
    return re.sub(r'\s*\(.*?\)', '', s).strip()
",False,True,False,True,"`s` is a string; the function `func` returns a string that has had all text within parentheses (including the parentheses themselves) removed from `s`, and any leading or trailing whitespace has been trimmed.","`s` is a string; the output of `func(s)` is a string with all text following and including the first opening parenthesis removed, along with any leading or trailing whitespace.","Explanation: The function uses a regular expression to remove all text within parentheses, including the parentheses themselves, from the input string `s`. The regular expression `r'\s*\(.*?\)'` correctly identifies and removes text in the format specified, and the use of `.strip()` ensures that any leading or trailing whitespace is also removed. This meets the specification provided. 
Correctness: **True**.","Explanation: According to the explanation, the function `func(s)` is designed to remove all text following and including the first opening parenthesis, along with any leading or trailing whitespace. However, the regular expression `r'\s*\(.*?\)'` will match from the first opening parenthesis to the last closing parenthesis and will remove everything in between, including any other text that may follow the last closing parenthesis. This behavior does not align with the specification, which states to remove only the text in between the first opening parenthesis and its corresponding closing parenthesis, not all occurrences. Therefore, the function does not meet the specification correctly.
Correctness: **False**.","Explanation: The function `func` uses a regular expression to remove parentheses and everything between them from the input string `s`. The pattern `r'\s*\(.*?\)'` matches any whitespace followed by an opening parenthesis, any characters (non-greedy) until a closing parenthesis, and removes that portion from the string. The `strip()` method is then applied to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the resulting string. This implementation correctly fulfills the specification by removing the specified content from the string.
Correctness: **True**."
